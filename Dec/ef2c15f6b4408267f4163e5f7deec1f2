FUGITIVE former Zanu  PF Manicaland youth chairman Mubuso Chinguno says he now regrets the decision to align himself with former First Lady Grace Mugabe and her G40 cabal. BY CLAYTON MASEKESA Speaking to NewsDay yesterday from his hideout in South Africa, Chinguno claimed he had been misled into believing Grace was the final arbiter in Zanu PF politics and that she was the kingmaker in both party and government. “When I was in G40 I was misinformed on everything. As youths we followed the G40 blindly. As youths we were young and too small on some actual issues that were happening,” Chinguno said. “I regret that I made certain decisions and statements associated with the G40 cabal based on the inadequate information I had. “I thought that as a loyal and dedicated party cadre I was doing the right thing, by supporting the former First Lady, not knowing that she had been compromised. “Note that as youths we are often not privy to certain information, especially that which is confidential, in the party and country particularly with regard to serious accusations against members of the party and national leadership.” The former youth leader said he was afraid of coming back home following his string of unrestrained attacks on then Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa before he took over from former President Robert Mugabe. “Let the dust settle first. I know what the other G40 members have gone through. But as of now I would like to apologise to President Emerson Mnangagwa and everyone who might have been offended by my actions,” Chinguno said. Other G40 members who have skipped the country and are yet to return include former ministers Saviour Kasukuwere, Jonathan Moyo, Patrick Zhuwao and Mandiitawepi Chimene, among others.
