TWO men allegedly caught trying to smuggle five stolen vehicles into Zimbabwe on the Limpopo River have been remanded in custody by a South African court. BY OWN CORRESPONDENT Tsununu Maphosa (31) and Mpho Dzuguda (23), believed to be Zimbabwean nationals, appeared in court in Masisi. A police update on the development of the matter said the duo would appear in court on February 10, 2018. “They have been remanded in custody by the Masisi Periodical Court today (Tuesday),” Constable Maphure Manamile said in a written update yesterday. Maphosa and Dzugudu were arrested on Saturday for possession of five of the six brand new Ford vehicles stolen from a Ford dealership garage in Phalaborwa. These cars were found after futile attempts to drive them across the Limpopo River into Zimbabwe. Some of the suspects fled, but the two were apprehended by South African police officers.
