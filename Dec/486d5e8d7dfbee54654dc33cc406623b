BUSINESSMAN and musician Energy Mutodi, who is facing charges of communicating false statements after allegedly implicating some politicians in the poisoning of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, yesterday asked the State to remove him from remand.
BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE Mutodi, who appeared before magistrate Elisha Singano,  is also facing another charge of insulting former President Robert Mugabe and causing disaffection among members of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces. The Zanu PF activist indicated that he would soon apply for refusal of further remand if the State fails to provide him with a trial date. Magistrate Singano postponed the matter to January 29, 2018, saying he would consider the defence’s request on the next remand date. During the bail application, police said Mutodi insinuated that there would be a coup and he was part of an organised syndicate of powerful people, whom they wanted to round up. Mutodi was arrested after he posted an article on social media platforms with the headline “Why choosing a successor is a difficult job”. In the article, he allegedly said decision-making in succession issues had always been a problem among Africans resulting in civil wars, repetitive coups and economic turmoil. He went on to cite examples of Muammar Gaddafi (Libya), Laurent Gbabgo (Ivory Coast) and Idi Amin (Uganda), among other countries which had the same problem. Mutodi posted several articles in support of Mnangagwa in the fluid Zanu PF succession race.
