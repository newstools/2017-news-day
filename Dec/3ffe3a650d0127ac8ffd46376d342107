DIGITAL painter Dananayi Muwanigwa last week hosted the RIMI Digital Art and Augmented Reality exhibition that showcased various artefacts at Batanai Gardens in Harare, two months after featuring at the Fak’ugesi African Digital Innovation Festival held in South Africa. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO Augmented is a technology that lays computer-generated images over a user’s view of the real world. It uses existing reality and physical objects to trigger computer-generated enhancements in real time.  “This is my first digital art exhibition in Zimbabwe. I first exhibited two months ago with Kombo Chapfika at Fak’ugesi Festival in South Africa. This is my first way of engaging with fellow artistes since Fak’ugesi,” he said. Muwanigwa said the exhibited pieces were a collection of work produced since the beginning of the year. “I chose augmented reality to show where we are going with art. I am a big digital art advocate, so I want to see it growing. There is so much you can do with this technology,” he said. “I themed the exhibition Digital Art Itself. In simple terms, digital art is art. It deserves space to be exhibited.” The exhibited pieces include Colour Blind, Ropa, The Quarter Life Crisis, Visitors, Chibhakera (Fist), Murwi (Heap) and Rimi (Flame). These are viewed using software called Unit Viforia installed in people’s phones or by use of 3D glasses. British Council director Sam Harvey congratulated Muwanigwa for hosting this inaugural digital art exhibition in Zimbabwe. “It’s a very new concept. One of our focuses is digital access to skills and education across Zimbabwe,” she said.
