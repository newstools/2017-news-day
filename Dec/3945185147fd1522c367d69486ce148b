SELF-PROCLAIMED Zanu PF cleric and Destiny for Afrika Network (DaNet) founder Obadiah Musindo has called on all stakeholders to support President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s economic turnaround strategies, describing the new Zanu PF leader as a shrewd business strategist. BY KENNETH NYANGANI  Addressing thousands of beneficiaries of his low-income housing scheme in Mutare on Saturday, Musindo  said Mnangagwa had already roped in his various global business connections to help resuscitate the economy. ‘’President Mnangagwa is a shrewd businessman and a God-fearing man. He speaks business and he knows business and he is a strategic man and l am confident that he is going to change the economy of this country. I don’t think there is a President in the entire Africa who knows about the economy than our President.  ‘’Many Africa countries have been earning billions of dollars because of their connections to China, look what they are doing in Angola and Mozambique and the same can be done here. ‘’Those who are opposing him are wasting their time , the man is anointed , he should not have survived the poisoning, only God saved him,  the bloodless takeover shows that God was behind the takeover,’’ Musindo said. ‘’The country needs a man like him. The business community has endorsed him, his companies are viable, some of the politicians’ businesses are broke and he is leading by example.’’  He said opposition parties were now in a panic mode because they knew that Mnangagwa had the capacity to turn around the economy and steal the political limelight from them. Meanwhile, DaNet Manicaland chairman Wilson Masokowere said the organisation had built a 125 000-litre water tank to assist thousands of their housing beneficiaries in the eastern border city. This came after the organisation recently launched a four-hectare community nutrition garden with a solar-powered borehole mainly to benefit the disadvantaged in the community.
