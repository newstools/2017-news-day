PROMINENT United Kingdom-based wheel spinner-cum-television and radio presenter, Tim Westwood, who was billed to headline this month’s edition of the Unplugged Concert in Harare, “snubbed” the show held on Saturday in the capital. BY PRECIOUS CHIDA The wheel spinner was expected to stage his debut performance in Zimbabwe, as part of his Africa tour alongside an array of local acts that include Edith WeUtonga, Hip Hop artiste, Takura, Transit Crew, Dj Reverb 7 and T Beats, among others. The event organisers were then forced to adjust their line-up, as they moved swiftly to rope in South African wheel spinner DJ Zinhle. Speaking to NewsDay yesterday, one of the concert co-founders Chiedza Danha said Westwood’s no-show was due to sickness. “We were disappointed that Tim Westwood could not make it. We were told by his management just two days prior to the event that he had come down with a severe case of influenza and was, therefore, told he would not be able to travel, not just to Zimbabwe, but also to the other countries that were included in his Africa tour,” she said. “We were committed to make our Unplugged Concert’s fourth year anniversary as amazing as possible. However, the issue was beyond our control.” Despite the non-appearance of the expected guest, thousands of people who attended the show were all the artistes who performed put up par excellence performances. Danha said sponsorship from Coca-Cola has brought a massive change to this year’s Unplugged  shows, adding that they have also made great headway with the artists development curriculum, which will come online next year. “The Unplugged Concert has grown immensely, and we achieved one of our chief goals of bringing in an international act. Coca-Cola has brought colour to the events and their sponsorship package allowed us to invest in different aspect of the event,” she said.
