The case in which NewsDay reporter, Kenneth Nyangani was facing charges of criminal nuisance has all, but collapsed after a Mutare magistrate, Sekai Chiwundura yesterday ruled that the State would proceed by way of summons after failing for the fifth time to provide a trial date. BY CLAYTON MASEKESA Nyangani was arrested over a story published two months ago suggesting that former First Lady Grace Mugabe donated used underwear to Zanu PF supporters in Dangamvura/Chikanga constituency in October through the local MP Esau Mupfumi. Nyangani’s lawyer, Brian Majamanda from the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights argued that his client had laboured a lot of reporting conditions, which were infringing on his right to personal liberty. “My client should be protected by the law in terms of section 56 of the Constitution,” Majamanda said. Chiwundura then asked the State why it was failing to provide a trial date. The State, represented by Arthur Bosha, said it was still conducting some investigations. The magistrate then ruled the case would proceed by way of summons.
