ZIMBABWEAN golf star Scot Vincent believes his moment of glory is getting close after yet another impressive show that saw him finishing third at the Asian Tour’s Indonesian Masters on Sunday.  BY HENrY MHARA Vincent carded a final round three under-par 69 for a 19-under total 269 total to finish solo third, behind second-placed Thailand’s Phachara Khongwatmai, who finished with an impressive 65 on the final day, and winner Justin Rose. The Englishman wrapped up the season in fantastic style, with a classy final round 10-under-par 62 to win the title by a career-best eight strokes after a total of 29-under-par 259, his third win in two months.   While it was Rose who stole the limelight and the headlines, Vincent showed remarkable improvement to his game, going into the final day of the season-ending event just three shots behind the eventual winner. Rose went on to hit  four consecutive birdies from the fifth before an eagle three at the ninth to race clear at the top of the leaderboard, while 18-year-old Khongwatma sneaked into second position.  Vincent though was still pleased with his performance, and believes he is getting closer to win a major title. “It has been an amazing week. Couldn’t have asked for  better experience to play with all these amazing guys and players. I didn’t think I was going to come to this tournament in the first place, it was a last-minute decision and I am so happy I did,” Vincent told Tee Time golf magazine. “My wife asked me every single day last week to come here and she convinced me when I played well in Joburg last week, so I am glad that I listened to her. Justin Rose played some of the best golf I have ever seen. I haven’t got a win yet, but I am knocking on the door and I will just keep doing what I am doing and I am sure it will come soon.”
