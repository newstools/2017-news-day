police officers in Bulawayo have been ordered to conform to service standards, shun corruption and maintain high standards of loyalty and discipline when discharging their duties. By LINDA CHINOBVA Speaking at a handover ceremony of the renovated Bulawayo Central Police Station on Tuesday, Officer Commanding Bulawayo province, Senior Assistant Commissioner Steven Mutamba said it was the mandate of the police to eradicate corruption from society. “In line with our constitutional mandate, we should reciprocate the good gesture from well-wishers by giving the community a service, which is above reproach and help in the building of our country,” he said. “The speech by His Excellency the President of Republic of Zimbabwe Emmerson Mnangagwa mentioned the need to eradicate corruption. Do not be part of it; instead fight it without fear or favour.” Mutamba said it was critical for police to maintain good relations with the public, as this helped in the prevention of crime. “As police officers, we must be visible to the public and make friends with them, in an effort to assert our role as crime prevention officers. The public is also urged to assist police officers in their fight against criminals,” he said. Some police officers, particularly from the traffic section, have been caught on the wrong side of the law, with others accused of extorting motorists or receiving bribes. The renovations at the front office of Bulawayo Central Police Station commenced in September this year at a total cost of
