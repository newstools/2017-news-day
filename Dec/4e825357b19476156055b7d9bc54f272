SOUTH AFRICA-BASED Zimbabwean motivational author, Melody Kanguru, will tomorrow launch two books Hosting Heaven and Hosting Heaven-The Study Guide at a free event themed Harare Meet and Greet at Batanai Gardens in Harare. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO Speaking to NewsDay yesterday, event co-ordinator Kenneth Kanguru said the day’s programme is designed in a way that will give readers and stakeholders an opportunity to interact with the author. “After unveiling the books in South Africa, Melody has decided to bring them home, where she will afford both the readers and stakeholders the opportunity to interact with her and give feedback on her writing,” he said.  Kanguru said the event will be graced by women who have made a meaningful impact in their leadership roles, with guests set to get signed and discounted copies of the books. Melody said she will be sharing an insight of the two books which are already available on Amazon, Kindle and iBooks. “These two books Hosting Heaven and Hosting Heaven-The Study Guide will feed readers with an insatiable hunger and thirst to hear God’s voice for their lives. In the book Hosting Heaven the reader will find an ordinary woman’s journey through learning for herself that hearing God is not a spiritual gift, but a birth right for every believer,” she said. “The questions enclosed in this book have been designed to help the reader self-introspect and do some ‘spiritual work’ to get ears and heart open to hearing God.”  Melody said through the books, she encourages believers to nurture a “personal relationship” with God, as they read my story, I hope they remember theirs and strive to fix whatever went wrong in their walk with God.
