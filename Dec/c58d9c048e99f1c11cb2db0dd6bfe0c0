A 24-YEAR-OLD HIV-positive Marondera student pastor who raped an 11-year-old girl who had come to buy vegetables at the church premises was yesterday slapped with an 18-year jail term by regional magistrate Clever Tsikwa, who found him guilty of rape charges. BY Jairos Saunyama Douglas Munetsi, a student pastor with Family of God Church based at Bethel Mission near Dormavale Farm, had pleaded not guilty to the charges of raping the juvenile, but was nailed due to overwhelming evidence levelled against him. He will, however, serve an effective 15-year jail term after three years were suspended on condition of good behaviour. According to court papers, on November 10, at around 1200hrs, the complainant was coming from Bethel Mission to buy vegetables when she saw the convict walking behind her.  Munetsi then approached the juvenile and offered her some snacks and she accepted. The accused dragged the juvenile behind a rock in a nearby bush and raped her once. On November 14, the complainant revealed her ordeal to her teacher, who then reported the matter to the police, leading to Munetsiâ€™s arrest.
