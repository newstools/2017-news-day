THE Christmas Challenge Cup football match that was supposed to be played by Zimbabwe and Zambia’s senior men’s teams at the weekend has been cancelled. BY SPORT REPORTER  Zifa announced the cancellation of the match yesterday saying the non-availability of the National Sports Stadium, which is booked for a wedding on the same day, had necessitated the development. On Sunday Zifa released a 24-member squad that was picked by coach Sunday Chidzambga (pictured), which was scheduled to go into camp tomorrow in preparation for the match. “The Zimbabwe Football Association regrets to inform all football stakeholders that the proposed Christmas Challenge Cup between the senior teams of Zimbabwe and Zambia has been cancelled due to the non-availability of the National Sports Stadium on 23 December,” read a statement from the association yesterday.  “The match between the legends of South African football and their counterparts from Zimbabwe which was supposed to serve as pre-match entertainment has also been called off. The association was advised that the facility is booked for a wedding on the same date, therefore, the friendly match cannot go ahead. Zifa is concerned by the prioritising of non-sporting events ahead of football matches when it comes to access to the National Sports Stadium. Zifa unreservedly apologises to all stakeholders for all inconveniences caused.” It’s not clear, however, why Zifa didn’t opt to move the match to alternative venues such as Rufaro Stadium in Harare or even Barbourfields in Bulawayo. Last month Zifa also cancelled the national team’s scheduled trip to Kenya where they had been invited to participate in the Cecafa tournament.
