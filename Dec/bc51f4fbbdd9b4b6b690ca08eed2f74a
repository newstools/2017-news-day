ZANU PF Manicaland province has welcomed the elevation of Oppah Muchinguri to the position of national party chairperson, saying the Environment, Water and Climate minister deserved such recognition given her long stay in the ruling party since the days of the liberation struggle. BY KENNETH NYANGANI  Muchinguri was appointed party chairperson at last week’s extra-ordinary congress, becoming the first female Zanu PF member to land the post which was previously a preserve of male former PF-Zapu cadres in line with the provisions of the 1987 Unity Accord. The last person to hold the post was Simon Khaya Moyo before it was abolished at the party’s 2014 congress. In an interview with NewsDay yesterday, Zanu PF Manicaland provincial secretary for administration Kenneth Saruchera said the province felt greatly honoured to provide the first female party chairperson.  Incidentally, Zanu’s founding chairperson, the late Herbert Chitepo, hailed from Manicaland province. “It’s a great honour to the province and at the same time it means a great responsibility for the province. The appointment is in recognition of her contribution to the liberation struggle and post-independence,” he said. “She led the emancipation of women in the country, we are proud of her and we are confident that she will live up to our expectations and she will also need our support and encouragement, but we know she has all the experience,” he said. The province had expected her to be appointed as one of the party’s two vice-presidents who are yet to be named by President Emmerson Mnangagwa.
