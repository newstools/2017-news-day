FORMER Mines ministry secretary Francis Gudyanga, who is accused of fraudulently awarding himself $28 910 in board fees and sitting allowances despite running a one-man board, was yesterday granted $300 by a Harare magistrate. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE  Gudyanga (69), who was not asked to plead when he appeared before magistrate Victoria Mashamba was remanded to January 16. He was ordered to report three times a week at Borrowdale Police Station and to surrender his passport to the clerk of court as part of his bail conditions.  The complainant is the State represented by the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe (MMCZ) general manager. It is the Stateâ€™s case that sometime in December 2013, MMCZ dissolved its board. Gudyanga was then appointed board chairman from December 2013 to September 2016. The State alleges that during the period, Gudyanga abused his office by claiming and receiving board fees and sitting allowances amounting to $28 910 from MMCZ. The MMCZ Act stipulates that a board should be made up of a minimum of six members and a maximum of 10, but during the period in question no board was appointed, meaning Gudyanga should not have received the money. The State alleges Gudyanga prejudiced MMCZ of $28 910 and nothing was recovered. Michael Reza appeared for the State.
