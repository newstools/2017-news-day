MANICALAND Provincial Affairs minister Monica Mutsvangwa yesterday claimed that Jonathan Moyo harassed her and several other government employees during his tenure as Information and Publicity minister. BY KENNETH NYANGANI/CLAYTON MASEKESA  She made the remarks while addressing heads of departments in Mutare, claiming that she almost resigned under Moyo. Mutsvangwa worked as Moyo’s deputy in the Information and Publicity Department a few years back. “At one time, I surrendered the books to Moyo and left, but I was restrained by others who encouraged me to stay.  It was sad to see board members and some senior members of staff shedding tears in frustration as they were continuously harassed by Jonathan Moyo,’’ she said. “People need to work freely so that they produce results and do their duties properly and, as heads of departments, we need to work together to develop our province which is endowed with  natural resources.”  When Moyo was Information minister, there were a lot purges in State media houses. He was accused of using State media to attack political foes within Zanu PF and in opposition parties. Staff from State media houses resigned because of frustration and those who refused to toe the line were fired. Mutsvangwa said she has an open-door policy and welcomes everyone regardless of political affiliation. She, however, emphasised that she could not be equated to her predecessor, Mandiitawepi Chimene, who is in self-imposed exile in Mozambique. “I will not refer to my predecessor; I will not talk about her. I will start on a new page. I will only take the good things. Don’t equate me with my predecessor. I know there might be unfinished businesses, but I will start on a new page,” she said.
Mutsvangwa said her main objective was to develop the province.
