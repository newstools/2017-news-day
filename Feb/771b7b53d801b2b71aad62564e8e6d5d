BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEMugabe s embarrassment was included in the State outline on Mawarire s charges of subverting a constitutionally-elected government and inciting the public to commit public violence.Mawarire is out of custody on $300 bail and was accompanied by his lawyer Harrison Nkomo when he appeared before magistrate Rumbidzai Mugwagwa, who remanded him further to March 16.It is the State s case that during the period extending from July 13 to December last year, Mawarire, the founder of #This Flag movement and senior pastor at His Generation Church, used print and electronic media to incite the Zimbabwean populace to revolt against Mugabe.The State alleges Mawarire urged Zimbabweans not to go to work and to shut down their businesses.
