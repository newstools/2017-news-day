THE trial of an Agriculture ministry accountant, Laston Mutaki and his elder brother, John, on allegations of swindling the government of $17 700 in a botched piggery supply deal faces collapse following the death of the State s key witness. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEOn Friday Laston (40) and John (56) appeared before Harare magistrate Nomsa Sabarauta, who postponed the matter to March 7 to allow the State to find another witness.The State sought the postponement of the trial, saying they are waiting for the death certificate of the former ministry s representative, Barnabas Tozivepi, who passed on before commencement of the trial.The State alleges that Laston s duties included maintenance of financial records for the pig levy under the Pig Industry Board. He and his elder brother were also co-directors of a private company, Generic Investments (Pvt) Ltd, which they allegedly used to syphon money from the ministry s accounts.Allegations are that between April and November 2015, the suspects originated fictitious documents alleging that their company Generic Investments had supplied goods and services to Pig Industry Board totalling $17 700.The State alleges Laston submitted the documents to the Agriculture ministry to facilitate payment, which was subsequently deposited into Generic Investment s bank account.The matter came to light after an internal audit revealed the fraudulent activity, and this led the ministry to report the matter to the police on April 20 last year.Meanwhile, a 41-year old suspected con artist appeared before magistrate, Victoria Mashamba charged with defrauding Howard Mission Hospital of close to $12 000 after posing as a fuel dealer.James Chirunga was granted $200 bail and remanded to March 30 on two counts of theft of trust property and one count of fraud. Allegations are that sometime in January this year, Howard Mission Hospital officials approached an army captain identified as, Crispen Mugweni, looking for fuel suppliers. Chirunga and the latter promised to supply 11 750 litres of diesel within seven days on condition he was paid $11 750 in advance.On January 11, the mission transferred the agreed amount into Chirunga s bank account. The Salvation Army-led mission also paid him another $100 to cover transport costs for the fuel.Chirunga failed to deliver the fuel and allegedly became evasive, leading to his arrest. He later reimbursed $4 000 and failed to pay the balance of $7 850.Chirunga also faces a related charge of duping Teddy Chigubhu of $15 300 using the same modus operandi.Chigubhu managed to recover $9 000. Chirunga is further accused of swindling a local woman, Nothando Cele of $920 after he misrepresented to her that he was in a position to facilitate loans from offshore funders.The State alleges after receiving the money Chirunga allegedly converted it to own use and became evasive. This prompted Cele to report the matter to the police.
