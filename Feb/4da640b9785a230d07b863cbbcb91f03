PREMIERSHIP side, Harare City could have made the transfer coup of the season after confirming the capture of two highly rated attackers, Malvin Gaki and Pritchard Mphelele. BY HENRY MHARAThe ambitious side have made an overhaul to the squad, offloading most of the veterans and replacing them with budding talents.Beside Gaki and Mphelele, City has also signed the experienced Protasho Kabwe, who signed from ZPC Kariba and former Mutare City Rovers defender Munyaradzi Sako.City Football Club secretary-general, Mathew Marara yesterday confirmed the signing of the quartet, whom he believes will take the club to the next level. We have signed those four to add on to what we believe is an already good and balanced side. We believe they can add value to the team, he said.While the four are shrewd buys, it is the capture of the Young Warriors duo of midfielders Gaki and striker Mphelele that could be seen as a sign of intent by City.The two starred in Kalisto Pasuwa-coached Young Warriors side, who beat fancied Cameroon to qualify for the All-Africa Games.Gaki is joining from Triangle, while Mphelele played for Hwange for the past few seasons.They have big shoes to fill at City, as they are coming in to replace Ronald Chitiyo, who joined Caps United and Raphael Manuvire, who has reverted back to ZPC Kariba.City have let go some their senior players, with captain Themba Ndlovu headlining the cast of those who were shown the exit door. Munyaradzi Dironyenye, Arnold Chivheya, Crispen Dickson and goalkeeper, Tafadzwa Dube are some of the seniors, who were deemed excess baggage.The club finished ninth last season, against a target of a top three finish, a position that cost coach Moses Chunga his job.They have elevated assistant coach Mkhuphali Masuku to head the technical team, although the former Highlanders coach falls short of the required minimum qualification by Zifa for all Premier League coaches.Masuku is a holder of a Caf B licence, while Zifa have said only those with Caf A would be allowed on the bench for league matches.Marara said they would stick with Masuku, saying Zifa s directive was only a recommendation .There are other reports that City are targeting former Warriors coach, Kalisto Pasuwa, who is now a free agent after his contract was not renewed by Zifa.Marara, however, dismissed the talk. We have never talked to him and we are not even considering him. We cannot afford him, Marara said.Pasuwa was earning a cool $7 000 a month at Zifa.
