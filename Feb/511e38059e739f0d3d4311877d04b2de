HOW Mine head coach, Kelvin Kaindu is keeping the bulk of his players from last year having let go of 2013 Castle Lager Soccer Star of the Year Tawanda Muparati, defender Victor Kamhuka and midfielder Fungai Chirinda. BY FORTUNE MBELEKelvin KainduThe trio s contracts expired on December 31 and have not been renewed and the Zambian gaffer yesterday said he would be bringing in one or two new faces with former Highlanders and South African First National Division outfit Witbank Spurs midfielder Peter Rio Moyo already in the gold miners books. There are some players that had their contracts not renewed and that includes Muparati, Kamhuka and Chirinda and we still have those three slots to fill and we are hoping that by the end of the week, we will be able to release our provisional squad for 2017, Kaindu said. There is one or two players that we will add, but I cannot disclose their names for now because there is still paperwork to be completed. How Mine got off to slow start last season, as Kaindu s charges struggled to adapt to his type of play, but on the last stretch he was happy with how they were coping.How Mine finished the 2016 season on 10th position, with only nine wins, 12 draws and nine defeats in the league. I believe we struggled to master the philosophy of our game and we lacked cohesion, but that improved immensely in the last five games last year. We saw a different How Mine and we are trying to adjust to that philosophy and for the sake of continuity I am keeping most of the players from last year s squad, he said. So far so good and we are not complaining, as all the players are back except for Mgcini Sibanda, who is injured from last year. In the last two weeks we have been training with our only Africa Cup of Nations representative, goalkeeper Donovan Bernard, and I am happy with the progress so far. Some of the players that Kaindu has retained faith in include Kudakwashe Musharu, Milton Ncube, Pasca Manhanga and Tsepo Ranthokoane.
