THE trial of Zanu PF Chirumanzu South legislator, Innocent Pedzisai, who is facing fraud allegations after he sold non-existent residential stands to unsuspecting homeseekers, failed to kick off at the Harare magistrates Court yesterday. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEPedzisai s trial was postponed to March 9 by Harare magistrate, Nomsa Sabarauta to allow the new prosecutor ample time to study the case.The legislator, who was the owner of the now-defunct Innop Housing Development Co-operative, is facing three counts of fraud allegations, after he allegedly sold non-existent residential stands to three people prejudicing them of $7 000.It is the State s case that sometime between September 2009 and August 2015, Pedzisai unlawfully misrepresented to Gibson Chibvongodze that he had a piece of land on offer. It is alleged Chibvongodze deposited $2 020 into Pedzisai s housing co-operative s bank account and he was allocated the stand and also issued with a copy of title deed, which was in the name of Marimba Residential Properties Limited.A few weeks later from the date of allocation, Chibvongodze allegedly discovered that someone had put a structure on the same piece of land. Pedzisai allegedly failed to give a satisfactory explanation, leading Chibvongodze to report the matter to the police.Using the same modus operandi, Pedzisai approached Beavan Mubaiwa and misrepresented to him that he has a piece of land, which was on offer. Mubaiwa paid $2 440 for the no-existent stand and he later discovered that someone had put a structure on the same land, which he was allocated. The State alleges Mubaiwa failed to get a satisfactory explanation leading him to report the matter to the police.The State further alleges that Pedzisai also duped Trymore Mutanga using the same modus operandi and got away with $2 210.Desire Chidanire appeared for the State.
