Emerging artist, Dumizulu Mnethwa (39), of Mbundane Township has ventured into an innovative genre of art, creating a fascinating huge rhino statue using steel wires picked from garbage dumpsites. BY NIZBERT MOYODumizulu MnethwaMnethwa told NewsDay that he wanted to do the project full-time and reach an international market. The rhino statue is now complete and my next target is a crocodile, then elephant and many more animals if resources permit, he said. My dream is to go overseas with this project and show it to the world. Mnethwa said he started the project in April last year, although he had been struggling to access materials.He said he had a friend, who often assisted him to pick steel wire from garbage sites.The artist, who said he had no formal training, added that his works were often inspired by his love for nature. I am in love with nature. I watch wildlife programmes on television, such as Animal Planet, and I get inspired by wild animals, he said. He said among the challenges he faced was the inaccessibility of steel wire and the lack of other gadgets, such as a computer and digital camera to take shots of animals for use in his artistic creations.
