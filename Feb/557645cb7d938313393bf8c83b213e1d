Tehn Diamond Fans are assured of a quality and uncompromised performance. We have been checking on marketing activities as we build up to the show. We are reaching out to fans through various means, he said. We encourage you to come in numbers as families, groups and individuals. The venue is secure, with state-of-the-art air conditioners, enlarged bathroom facilities, huge parking space and a carrying capacity of 300, the only venue with such space in Mutare and if not best in Zimbabwe. With the liquidity crunch facing the country, organisers of the event assured the fans that there would be swipe machines for the fans convenience. The hotel has been hosting various events. Last year, it hosted the Summer Beer Festival, which was the first of its kind in Mutare and this year, it successfully held a Valentine s gig.Sometime last year, there were allegations that Ammara and Tehn Diamond were an item, but both artistes insisted they were just good friends, as Ammara said she was best friends with Tehn Diamond s fianc e, ZiFM Stereo presenter Lorraine Lochnation Bgoya.The presenter dismissed the claims as ridiculous .
