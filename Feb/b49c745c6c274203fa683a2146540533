He knows where to find us, Hara said.Meanwhile, Chicken Inn have confirmed bringing on board Hwange holding midfielder, Innocent Mucheneka and parting ways with midfielder, Canaan Nkomo, while closing the door on former ZPC Kariba midfielder, Elvis Meleka.Meleka has been trying his luck with the former league champions for the past two weeks. We have signed Mucheneka from Hwange and at Chicken Inn, we don t sign a player for less than two years. The coach (Rahman Gumbo) has asked (Canaan) Nkomo to look for another club, where he can get game time, as you know he has not been playing for a while here. (Elvis) Meleka has been training with us, but he has also been told to look elsewhere, Hara said.Chicken Inn, who have also signed striker Kudakwashe Gurure from Mutare City Rovers, beat Hwange 1-0 in a friendly match at the Colliery on Saturday.Gurure and Mucheneka played for Chicken Inn in that match.
