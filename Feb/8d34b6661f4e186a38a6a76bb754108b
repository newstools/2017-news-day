THE ZNA Charities Shield semi-final tie between Highlanders and FC Platinum scheduled for tomorrow has been moved to March 12, as Barbourfields Stadium is waterlogged due to heavy rains that have been pounding the city in the last few days. BY FORTUNE MBELELieutenant-Colonel Fabion Chitungo of the army public relations announced that the match had been moved, while the other semi-final between Dynamos and Caps United at the National Sports Stadium tomorrow is still on. The Barbourfields match has been postponed to March 12 due to the state of the pitch, which is waterlogged. After consultations with the responsible authorities, our local organising committee was informed by the Premier Soccer League that the city council cannot do anything to improve the situation after inspection of the facility, Chitungo said.The postponement means that the final which had been scheduled for March 5, will also be moved to a later date.
