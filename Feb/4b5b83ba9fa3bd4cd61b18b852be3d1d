MDC-T councillors in Binga have accused their Zanu PF counterparts, including chief executive officer, Joshua Muzamba, of denying them access to the results of a government audit conducted at the local authority last year. BY SILAS NKALAGovernment in August last year despatched auditors to investigate alleged financial impropriety at Binga Rural District Council (BRDC) following a request by Binga North MP, Prince Dubeko Sibanda, who accused Muzamba of misusing council funds.Councillor Themba Munkombwe said the audit report was given to various council committee leaders on February 14, but had not yet been tabled for discussion. It was said councillors could not be given some copies of the report for confidentiality purposes. Councillors have a right to be given copies since they run council because if the confidentiality is only kept by the management, it means councillors are useless, he said.Munkombwe said the audit reportedly states that he should be charged over Campfire money misuse and made to pay back, a development he described as flawed.Contacted for comment yesterday, Muzamba said he could not comment as he was in a meeting.Sibanda demanded the audit of BRDC after he wrote to Rural Development and Preservation of Culture and Heritage minister Abednigo Ncube asking the government to probe top council officials over alleged abuse of over $100 000.Sibanda said the alleged abuse of funds was due to high travelling allowances, compared to other local authorities, contributing to council s liquidity and operational challenges. The legislator said, while on average other rural district councils pay about $55 in travel allowances a day, Binga pays $150.He said he was told that the council chairperson, Dube Munkombwe, and Muzamba in October and November 2015, claimed over $5 000 per month each for undeclared trips, whose purposes remain questionable.
