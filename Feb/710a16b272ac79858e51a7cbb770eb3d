BY FORTUNE MBELELloyd MutasaMutasa said Dynamos fans have a chance of taking a glimpse of the new faces in his squad, who have been blended with the old guard as they face Zimbabwe s Confederation of African Football (Caf) Champions League representatives Caps United.The gaffer reckons the match, will be a good test for Dynamos ahead of the start of the 2017 Premier Soccer League season. It s a good match for us in terms of preparations. It will give us the picture to this season. It might be a charity match, but Dynamos and Caps matches have always been difficult, Mutasa said. We want to be victorious and the mentality is we want to win; this match is no exception. We have done our part and we will use the players that we have at our disposal and our fans will see the new and old faces in the squad as we hope to progress to the next round, Mutasa said.Ocean Mushure, Obey Mwerahari, Elisha Muroiwa, Wisdom Mutasa, Valentine Ndaba and Denver Mukamba are some of the older players that Dynamos managed to retain following the departure of some of their star players who opted for greener pastures.The new faces are Pakanani Dube, Romario Chinetsa, Gift Saunyama, Cleophas Kapupurika and Valentine Kadzonzo. DeMbare have also been joined by Emmanuel Mandiranga from Bulawayo City.The Glamour Boys recently took their preparations to Mozambique where they played a couple of friendly matches.Tomorrow s clash will be a good practice match for Caps United, who scrapped past Lesotho s Lioli in the preliminary round of the Caf Champions League and face Democratic Republic of Congo giants TP Mazembe in the first round.They travel to Lubumbashi for the first leg on the weekend of March 10-12, and coach Lloyd Chitembwe will be looking forward to give his players a run to try and improve sharpness, which was evidently lacking in their matches against the Lesotho side.Veteran striker, Leonard Tsipa, who is not part of the Champions League squad, may also get a feel of a match situation tomorrow.With former Dynamos stars Ronald Chitiyo, Tafadzwa Rusike and Devon Chafa in the Caps ranks, the match is poised to be an explosive one.
