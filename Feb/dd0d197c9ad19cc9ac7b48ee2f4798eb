Our album received a tremendous welcome from the day of the launch. We started off by distributing our copies to family, friends and church members. Since then, the response has been overwhelming, he said.The album contains four songs from Ghetto Praise Choir and 11 others produced by the group s founding members Esther Mukazika-Matanga, Naison Mazivisa, Dayton Marasha, Hazel Mkazikah, Kudzai Chimbare, Orion Mtima, Joshua Mtima, Bruce Majonga, Benjamin Musemburi, Desire Mudadi and Dereck Mpofu, who is the producer of the album.The album carries songs such as Gandanga, which encourages people to stay strong and be able to defeat every stronghold that may try to pull them down from enjoying the goodness of the Lord.
