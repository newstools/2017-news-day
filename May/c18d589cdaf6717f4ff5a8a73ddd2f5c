We take you through, in video, the daily life at Zimbabwe&#8217;s tobacco auction floors. After the hustle of growing their crop, tobacco farmers end their journey at the auction floors. It is at the floors, like Tobacco Sales Floors in Harare, where vendors, sex workers and other business people gather to sell their products to the poor farmers, who often end up being shortchanged, robbed, or conned.We give you in pictures, what happens at the floors.
