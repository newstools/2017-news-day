Harare City Council now owes suspended town clerk James Mushore more than $130 000 in unpaid salaries for the past 13 months as the government and the local authority continue to squabble over his appointment. BY XOLISANI NCUBEJames MushoreMushore, who was sent on leave two weeks after taking over from Tendai Mahachi, has not been paid despite holding a contract of employment with council.Harare mayor Bernard Manyenyeni confirmed that council owed Mushore over one year s salary. At law, he has a contract and there is a council resolution giving him the job as town clerk. It would be unfortunate if he wins his case in the courts, we will be guided by council, Manyenyeni said.According to council sources, Mushore as the town clerk was entitled to a monthly salary of $10 000 plus non-momentary benefits which include fuel and an official vehicle. We are awaiting the final verdict from the courts on the way forward. I don t know what will be the outcome, but as far as I know, he has an offer letter and a council resolution thereof for the post or job. We had hired him to work as our town clerk, but unfortunately, he is not working, Manyenyeni said.The former banker signed a two-year contract with Harare City Council on April 1 last year, but has remained stuck at home for the past 13 months.Manyenyeni was once suspended by Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere on allegations of breaching appointment procedures.
