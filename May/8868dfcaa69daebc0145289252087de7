CAPS United s pursuit of greatness in continental football begins this evening when the local champions kick off their Group B Caf Champions League campaign with a match against five-time champions Zamalek of Egypt in Alexandira. KEVIN MAPASURE Abbas AmiduThe match kicks off at 9pm local time and it will be broadcast live on SuperSport 9.Caps United will start off as underdogs against last year s losing finalists, who are looking to make a quick start with a win at home.But the Green Machine are seemingly fearless of their opponents reputation and impressive records.It is likely that Caps United will set themselves out to destroy and disturb Zamalek in the hope of clinching at least a point.Defensive discipline has been part of their mantra ahead of the trip.Left-back Ronald Pfumbidzai said the Green Machine would not be worried about reputations when they step out this evening. Zamalek is just a name and history does not win you games, Pfumbidzai said. What is important is how you play on a particular day. We know they have won the trophy five times and they were in the final last year, but this is a different edition altogether and we also want to do well. It is Zamalek who are under pressure and they are worried about us since we also knocked out another five-time champion (TP Mazembe). The Green Machine will need good defensive organisation and they showed that they can do it in the two legs against TP Mazembe.They had to defend for their lives in Lubumbashi and at home they also shut out Mazembe, limiting them to half chances.Lloyd Chitembwe will demand a perfect performance from his backline that is likely to include Hardlife Zvirekwi, Dennis Dauda and Justice Jangano.It is possible he could leave out Pfumbdzai and go with Musarurwa, who is said to be more solid in defence than the former, who is brilliant with the ball. Abbas Amidu (pictured) has been a reliable source of goals for Caps and he is likely to lead the line again.
