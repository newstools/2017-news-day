In an interview with NewsDay Sport, HCA publicity and public relations director Keith Mugozori said the tournament was not only to commemorate Africa Day, but also a chance for schools to prepare for the African schools championships. This is the first tournament we have held on Africa Day. The idea around hosting the Harare Open, particularly on Africa Day, is not only confined to commemorating the formation of the African Union, but also to quench the thirst for chess tournaments as well as development among the royal game enthusiasts, he said Scholars are encouraged to go in for the tournament with a view to using it as a preparatory platform for the upcoming African National Schools Individual Championships set for August, 2017. About 150 chess players from different parts of the country are expected to take part in the three-day event. HCA would also like to thank Crystal Candy for funding the event, especially at a time when it s extremely difficult to find corporates who are willing to fund chess activities in this country, Mugozori said.The tournament will start at 9am on each day.
