TWENTY local female artists have been selected to participate in a photography and spoken word exchange project between Harare and London running under the theme, These Images are Stories. BY ARTS REPORTERBatsirai ChigamaThe aim of the project is to tell stories through photographs and words as catalysts for positive social change.In a statement issued by Exist Digital public relations on behalf of the programme organisers, the artists are to tell stories around social themes on young women growing up in the 21st century through creating photographic and poetic works.Programme participants are Tanatsei Gambura, Chelsy Maumbe, Samantha Mukuwaya, Cynthia Marangwanda, Tariro Ndoro, Musa Bwanali, Sumayya Dada, Tamary Kudita, Clarity Sibanda and Zandile Gozo.Top poet, Batsirai Chigama, who is going to be the spoken word mentor, said the project was going to help participants open up and discover issues that surround their societies. The project is an opportunity for the poets to critically look at situations surrounding their environment, to be aware of what is happening and begin to try and understand, either good or bad and how all this plays a major role in the well-being of an individual, community and country as a whole, Chigama said.Visual mentor, Laurie Macpherson, said the participants will learn about making their images stand out. In a screen-dominated world, we are bombarded by imagery daily be it advertising, social and print media or on our computers and in order to have an image stand out from the barrage of photographs we are subjected to, it needs to have key elements to grab one s attention, she said.The project is a partnership between the British Council, Impact Hub Islington, Impact Hub Harare, All Change Arts and Zimbo Jam.Works to be produced during the project will be showcased in an online gallery and in exhibitions in Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom.
