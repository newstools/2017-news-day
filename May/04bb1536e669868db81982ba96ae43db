BY FORTUNE MBELEJairosi Tapera (right)The top-flight new boys suspended their technical team, which is headed by Jairos Tapera, ahead of the match.Manager Munyaradzi Sinani, team medic Victor Katsande and physiotherapist Mike Mavhura sat in the dugout.Zifa yesterday released a statement pointing out that the Walter Magaya-owned side had brought the game of football into disrepute by disregarding club licencing regulations.Xolisani Gwesela, who is the manager of club licensing, said the football mother body would act accordingly against Yadah FC for the misdemeanour. The absence of a qualified technical team during a professional league match makes a mockery of top-flight football in Zimbabwe, Gwesela said. Zifa will not stand by and watch Yadah FC dragging football into an abyss. Zifa will take corrective measures to deal with this presumptuous disregard of club licencing dictates. The association has ordered Yadah FC management to put their house in order and ensure that they have qualified personnel manning their technical bench in their next league assignment, as per club licensing requirements, Gwesela said.Yadah FC went on to lose the match 7-2.They play their next league match against Chicken Inn at the National Sports Stadium on Saturday.The club has said that they will have coaches on the bench in their next match, but it is not clear whether they will restore Tapera.
