FORMER Highlanders fans heartthrob Masimba Mambare, who has scored each time he has faced Bosso since he left the club in acrimonious circumstances, returns to Barboufields on Sunday, hoping to inflict more pain on those who once idolised him. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKAMasimba MambareMambare had established himself as a household name at Bosso after joining from Motor Action, but when he decided to leave Bosso, it was met with disapproval by the Bulawayo football giants fans with the Press even describing him as a traitor.While Mambare has not made such a big impact at Dynamos after his switch, as he is fighting the ravages of injuries, he has always stood out whenever he plays against his former team.His name always appears on the score sheet even when Dynamos lose against Highlanders.He scored in his first game for Dynamos when they beat Highlanders 2-0 in the Bob Super Cup and last season, when DeMbare lost to Bosso at Barbourfields, Mambare did not play a part in the 2-0 defeat because of injury, but he was on the score sheet in the 2-1 loss to Highlanders, thus underlining his abilities under the weight of expectations.This season, he came from the bench during the Independence Cup final to score the first goal before Highlanders levelled matters to force the match into the penalty shootout with Dynamos eventually lifting the trophy.But as they prepare for another encounter at Barbourfields on Sunday, Mambare said what was important was to handle the pressure that comes with games of that magnitude. I remember I have always scored against Highlanders ever since I left in 2014, but it s not about me only, it s about the team, Mambare said as he attempted to dodge the limelight. Of course, we won against them in the Independence Cup, but this is a completely different game. It s a league match. What is important is to handle the pressure because there is a lot of pressure in these kind of games. We will go there with a positive mentality. Although Highlanders were beaten to the Independence Cup, they derive their confidence from the fact that they are the current log leaders and sparks are certain to fly.
