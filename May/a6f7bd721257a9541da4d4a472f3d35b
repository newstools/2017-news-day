SHABANIE MINE boast that they have the most talented squad in the country as they prepare to host former coach Tendai Chikuni s struggling Chapungu in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Maglas tomorrow. BY MUKUDZEI CHINGWEREChikuni goes into the match with his side languishing at the base of the log standings and in desperate need of maximum points. He was in charge of the miners last year when they were promoted into the country s elite division, making him fully geared for the encounter with the inside knowledge he possesses. In their armoury, Chapungu can field a line-up composed of players formerly on the books of Shabanie Mine.Shabanie Mine have played beyond expectations this season considering their small budget and will be hoping for maximum points. Club technical manager Taku Shariwa boasted that they have the best squad in the country and Chikuni s knowledge of the team is very limited. In terms of talent, our team is the best in Zimbabwe. Our only problem is finance, Shariwa said We have changed a lot this season since we arrived and our former coach s knowledge of the current team is little. We have been playing well this season and we hope to collect as many points as possible especially during the first half of the season as in the second half of the season it will be difficult. Chapungu played brilliantly last week when they managed to restrict log leaders Highlanders to a scoreless stalemate.Chikuni said his team has been playing well and it is now time to start collecting points, adding that his former side is doing well. Shabanie are doing very well this season and it will be a difficult game for both teams. We have also been playing well this season and we now want to convert that into results. That I was once with them I do not think it has any significance because the team has changed a lot, he said.
