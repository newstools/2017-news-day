HARARE CITY&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. 0 DYNAMOS&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.(1) 1DYNAMOS coach, Lloyd Mutasa was a relieved man after Christian Ntouba s wonder goal earned the Harare giants maximum points against Harare City in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at the National Sports Stadium last night. BY HENRY MHARAThe Cameroonian volleyed home in the 36th minute, connecting a knockdown from Obey Mwerahari following a corner kick.The win was a huge relief for Mutasa, who came into the match under immense pressure following a run of poor results.Reports suggested Mutasa had been given an ultimatum to win this match, failure of which he would be sacked.Mutasa sang Ntouba s praises and believes the win will spur the team going forward. It was a wonder goal from a great player, and worth three points. This win should be a turning point and if we can take another three points in the next match, it will enhance our chances going forward, Mutasa, who is looking to get his team s first home win when they host ZPC Kariba on Sunday, said.As for City, it was a bad start for new coach, Philani Ncube, who was given the reins on Wednesday this week following the demotion of Mike Madzivanyika. The potential is there. We were a better side. It s just that our conversion rate is poor. There are going to be changes to the team and Sunday, it s three points, Ncube said.Dynamos had a positive start to the game, with Emmanuel Mandiranga having some creative runs on the wings.Ocean Mushure tried his luck from a free kick just outside the box, but the Dynamos captain missed the target.At the other end, City&#8217;s best chance fell to Farai Madhanhanga, whose shot was tipped over by an alert Tonderai Mateyaunga in goals for Dynamos.Dynamos finally got the breakthrough when Mandiranga s corner was headed into the danger area by Mwerahari for Ntouba to volley home first time.Ncube s reaction to the setback was to pull out an ineffective Malvern Gaki for Protasho Kabwe before half-time, as he sought some movement and a response.But the former Highlanders and ZPC Kariba midfielder wasted the team&#8217;s best chance early in the second half when he headed over a Martin Vengesai cross, with only the keeper to beat.Mateyaunga almost gifted City a way back into the match when he dropped the ball from a corner and Honey Chimutimunzeve pounced, but Lincoln Zvasiya spared his blushes, blocking on the goal line.Teams: Harare City: M Nyamupangedengu, T Chimwemwe, E Zinyama (R Kufandada, 78&#8242;), M Vengesai, R Uchena, P Mpelele, T Samanja, J Chipangura (H Chimutimunzeve, 57&#8242;), W Manondo, M Gaki (P Kabwe, 41&#8242;), J TigereDynamos: T Mateyaunga, P Makaha, O Mushure, M Machazane, L Zvasiya, T Chipunza, O Mwerahari, M Mambare (T Sadiki, 67&#8242;), E Mandiranga (D Mukanga, 78 ), Q Kangadze (W Mutasa, 87&#8242;), C Ntouba</strong>
