HUNDREDS of fun lovers thronged Nkulumane 5 s Bullet Shopping Centre on Sunday to celebrate Umqombothi Sports Bar s relaunch, following the completion of renovations. BY SINDISO DUBEThe sports bar has been revamped to fit upmarket standards set up, lighting and also a VIP area has been erected. Revellers from around Bulawayo could not miss the opportunity to have the first feel of the new-look spot. Umqombothi is a vernacular name for opaque beer. The place was well-known for offering traditional beer since 2004. The management has since revamped the place to suit all age groups and tastes. The place is now bigger and better. We now accommodate the young revellers who, for a long time, had cried foul over being left out. We now have an upmarket set up which the young people longed for in the ghettos. At the same time we have maintained our traditional clientele. We are not doing away with anyone but we are just adding more people and more fun, said Zandile Moyo, the sports bar s spokesperson. Revellers enjoyed their drinks, braai meat and music from DJs Sweeto, FFF Molfy, St Wilz, Phibz, Sherrif, Demz d, Stones and Kul Jeff, among others. The sports bar is calling on local wheel spinners to participate in the DJ battle to be hosted by DJ Sweeto next week. The winners will be then taken in as resident DJs at the joint on full time basis. We want the best of the best. Next week, we are hosting a DJ s battle where we will select the cream of wheel spinners who will be employed at Umqombothi to help out the ever busy DJ Sweeto, Moyo said.
