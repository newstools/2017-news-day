THE Zimbabwe Musicians Union (Zimu) has set up a women s desk and is currently in the process of compiling data on female musicians as part of efforts to empower and promote local female musicians. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOEdith WeUtongaAfro-fusion musician, Edith WeUtonga, the union s interim president, told NewsDay yesterday they had put in place a raft of initiatives to empower women in music. We are calling for all women in music to be involved by submitting their contact details for the compilation of the database of our Zimbabwe female musicians, she said, adding that the desk would be officially launched at a date yet to be announced.WeUtonga said female musicians, who are Zimbabwean nationals, should submit their full names, short profile and booking contacts and the information we be used to compile the data. This will enable us also to keep abreast with their activities and include them in the union programming, she said.The initiative, WeUtonga said, was also meant to get female artistes to work together and help create a better working environment. We are also set to introduce the Women in Music nights an initiative to showcase our talents as female musicians as we seek for our recognition in this male dominated industry, she said.WeUtonga said although she was happy with the growth of the union since its formation three years ago, there was still a lot to be done, as there was need to set up structures across the country.She said they had so far registered hundreds of musicians and set up new structures in the Bulawayo, Masvingo and Midlands regions through a partnership programme with the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe. We are also in the process of joining the world board, the International Federation of Musicians and the procedure is at an advanced stage, WeUtonga said, adding that affiliation would give local female artistes exposure and a chance to interact with foreign artistes cultural exchange programmes.She said by end of this year they would have put up structures in Mashonaland East and West, Masvingo and Manicaland.Other schemes in the offing, WeUtonga said, included financial literacy programmes related to the use of proper business and accounting models in their trade.
