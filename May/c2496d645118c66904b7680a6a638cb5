The first play they picked was Missing Diamonds, I Need My Share, where I was arrested together with three journalists from the private media who were covering the play. The award committee said it was also impressed by The Prison Uniform and The Mud, he said. For this award, I want to thank the media for covering my three plays extensively as the jurors for the award picked them from online publications, the activists from all social movements, mainly Tajamuka, who gave me the backing and security during my performances and all Zimbabweans who want to see a better Zimbabwe who shared the videos via social media. Mudzvova, who is currently in the United Kingdom, where he was also selected for a year-long Artist Protection Fund Fellowship programme at the University of Manchester, said he will continue contributing towards a better Zimbabwe using his artistic talent.Several media platforms have been awash with congratulatory messages for Mudzvova with pro-democracy activist and #ThisFlag founder, Evan Mawarire being among the people who took to Facebook to congratulate him.
