IN an endeavour to promote culture and heritage tourism, Zimbabwe Organic and Natural Food Association (Zonfa) is set to open a village, Ekhayeni The African Village during the first week of August in Harare. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO/ PRECIOUS CHIDAThe Zonfa director, Victor Marufu, told NewsDay that the opening of the village built on four hectares of architectural beauty and creative design in Harare will bring an assortment of different ways of living, stimulating a healthy community and promoting African cultures. The opening of Ekhayeni The African Village brings the taste of the real Africa, all encapsulated within a shopping environment that has been designed to entertain and inspire, while promoting cultural and heritage tourism, Marufu said. African nations have lacked a forum to showcase and sell produce as well as showing off their expertise, so we have stepped up and we are offering a unique market place. He said the village will blend the desires and needs of any shoppers as it will feature food outlets, farmers markets, children s play centre, events centre, music studio, art studio, hair studio and nail bar, communication centre, herbal shop, tour operators and travel agencies, African couture outlets, art and craft shops and plants and herbs nursery. The events centre will be the heartbeat of our village as it will host many functions including, cultural festivals, fashion shows, music festivals and competitions, he said.Marufu said the music studio will offer educational classes for pre-schoolers up to teens, adding that there will be an early childhood music education programme to be taught by qualified teachers. Art classes at our studio are designed to intentionally develop the inner artist, having been structured around weekly themes encouraging experimentation and creativity with the aim of unleashing the artist within, he said. Our art and craft shop will carry extraordinary, exotic and unique collections of African arts and craft products, offered at the most competitive prices. He said the African couture outlets will not just be about clothing, but visual statements that are part of art and fashion.
