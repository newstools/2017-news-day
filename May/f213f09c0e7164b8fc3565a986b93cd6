THE Bulawayo North province of the Apostolic Faith Mission Church in Zimbabwe (AFM) has donated five tonnes of clothing and blankets and a number of household goods to hundreds of families displaced by this year s flash floods in Tsholotsho district. BY NIZBERT MOYOSpeaking at the handover ceremony yesterday, AFM president Reverend Aspher Madziyire said the donation was part of the church s corporate social responsibility. We were touched by the plight of children and the elderly. We were then reminded of what the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 13 v 1: Though I speak with tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal, Madziyire said.The AFM leader expressed hope that the donation would go a long way in complementing efforts by other organisations to assist the flood victims. I hope it will galvanise more organisations and more churches in similar action as we all rally together behind the Tsholotsho flood victims cause, Madziyire said.Speaking on behalf of the victims, Matabeleland North Provincial Affairs minister Cain Mathema said: It is a great day that you as church members have donated tonnes and tonnes to those that have been affected. It is not every day that it happens to give. I love the hand that gives, it is not all the hand that gives, some take away.
