SUNGURA maestro Alick Macheso will once again headline the Surrey Braai Festival set for May 27 along the Harare-Mutare Highway in Marondera. BY OWN CORRESPONDENT Alick MachesoThe Extra-basso, who performed at the launch of the Surrey Braai Area last year, will share the stage with zimdancehall man of the moment Soul Jah Love, while rising sungura artiste, Maxen Maxen will be the opening act.The latest edition of the braai fest will be held overnight, a departure from tradition as the first two editions were held during the day.Surrey Group national sales manager, Ranganayi Zihumo, said all is set for the festival and urged revellers to get ready for an all-night of fun. The selection of the artistes is by public demand. The youths prefer Zimdancehall and the adults prefer Macheso. As you know Macheso is capable of pushing for a very long time and this is the reason why it is going to be an all-night of joy, he said. Soul Jah love is on top of the game with his Pamamonya song, so I believe this will be one of the best shows ever at Surrey for the people. Those attending the show will pay $5 before getting a braai pack. The Surrey Braai Festivals are fast becoming popular, judging by the huge number of people who attended the previous two events. After the launch by Macheso alongside Pengaudzoke, contemporary musician Jah Prayzah and Afro-jazz artiste Calvin Mtukudzi performed at the second event.The Surrey Braai Area has a number of braai stands dotted across the venue, while the leading meat company will ensure a constant supply of braai packs, as refrigerated trucks will be stationed inside the venue.
