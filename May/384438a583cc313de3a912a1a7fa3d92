By Stephen ChadengaChikozho said debtors should visit council offices to make payment plans on how to settle their bills. We are currently owed $18 290 628 by industrial and commercial consumers with government departments owing us $4 427 679, Chikozho said. We are also currently owed $29 501 105 by residential consumers and the total from our debtors as at March 31, 2017 is at $52 219 411. He said although council has since handed some of the debtors to lawyers they [debtors] should come to the local authority to make negotiations for settling their bills.Chikozho also revealed council s creditors were at $42 215 735, with the municipality owing Zesa $23 123 498. We have since entered a deed of settlement with ZETDC at the High Court of Zimbabwe in Harare in which we are paying $60 000 monthly in a bid to liquidate the arrears, he said. This is not withstanding the current monthly average bill of electricity amounting to $280 000. The city father said the bulk of the electricity bill is due to the high cost of pumping water mainly from Gwenoro water pump station.
