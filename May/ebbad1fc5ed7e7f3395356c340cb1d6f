We take you through the streets of Harare, and get you to watch the state of the Sunshine City in 2017. From spike-wielding traffic police officers on street corners, to vendors and their carts everywhere. We also show you &#8216;money-changers&#8217; and flea marketeers and more. This is just part one. Wednesday next we will show you more of Harare in our part two. Produced by Tapiwa Zivira and Shepherd Tozvireva
