LOCAL musician, Simbarashe Abel Piyo, who goes by the name Piyo Matosie, has been disillusioned by the genre of his choice Zimdancehall. BY PRECIOUS CHIDAPiyo has had a change of heart, taking up a new genre that blends Afro-jazz, Afro-pop and reggae, hoping for better luck.Although the musician has been playing Zimdancehall since 2012, he has had a light-bulb moment, realising that the genre was likely to stretch only as far as the taste of bubble gum. I want to create lasting music, something that can last for future generations, Piyo told NewsDay in a recent interview. This is something that I always wanted to do, but I could not get the right people to assist me. He singled out musicians like Oliver Tuku Mtukudzi, whose touch in the music fraternity has defied the test of time. People still listen to his 1994 music and enjoy it, whereas some Zimdancehall artistes music has already faded away after a month of release, Piyo observed.Inspired by Tuku and contemporary musician, Jah Prayzah, the 23-year-old musician recently released three singles Uchengete Vana, Makiss Dhondoro and Hakuna Muteuro which he said deal with real life issues. My music comes from the things that people face in their day-to-day lives, he said. Hakuna Muteuro is a message to people to utilise the chances they get in life so that they won t regret it later. Piyo released his debut 16-track album in 2013 and has previously collaborated with Crystall Rich and Tocky Vibes.
