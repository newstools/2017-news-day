It is good to be showcasing my designs at such a prestigious event. My designs were inspired by things that surround me. Anything that I hear or see can make me create any type of design and my latest collection for 2017 will be coming soon, she said.Gweje, who has been in the fashion industry for the past 14 years, said although it has not been an easy journey, she has tried her best to withstand it all. I have been in the fashion industry since 2003 and the journey has been hard, but in that hardness I am still growing and I am still surviving, I have really stood my ground, she said.Gweje, whose designs are inspired by the things around her, said she will be showcasing some of her projects at the National Arts Gallery next month.The fashion show that featured models from Size4 Modelling Agency was co-ordinated by the agency s stylist and founder, Wilbert Rukato.While the fashion designers wanted to enlighten people on fashion skills, the audience, who attended the event, wore different styles with some of them being disastrous and others looking amazing.Meanwhile, away from the fashion show extravaganza, there was entertainment galore, as thousands of merrymakers, who graced the free event were entertained by Winky D, Freeman, Judgement Yard and Andy Muridzo.The musicians had a good day in office, as they managed to thrill fans on their separate sets. It was, however, Muridzo s rendition of Bob Marley s Redemption Song that sent the fans into a frenzy.As usual, with his energetic performance, Winky D wrapped up the concert in style as he left fans clamouring for more.
