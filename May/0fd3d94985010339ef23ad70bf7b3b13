BULAWAYO-based award-winning house music maniac Skaiva has embarked on an expedition dubbed Against All Odds Tour , starting with his city before going around Zimbabwe. BY SINDISO DUBESkaivaThe tour comes after the producer and wheel spinner launched his debut album, Against All Odds, last month at Groove Night Club.On Saturday, Skaiva will perform at Pub Lagondola, where he will be supported by Slimzar, Ryan Synth, MdueSevan, Renovation Boyz, Soul Identity, DJ Sbago, Zulu and Wycliff. The album has been received very well in Bulawayo. I have performed at different clubs, including the ghettos, and the love I have seen is humbling, Skaiva said.After the Bulawayo invasion, the artiste will take his act to Gwanda, Victoria Falls, Gweru, Harare, Mutare and other cities and towns to be advised soon. We want to show the nation that house music lives in Zimbabwe. So after the Bulawayo invasion, we will take the act to different parts of the country. As much as hip-hop and dancehall have a large following in the country, I believe house music has followers, but people have not been really exposed to the music, hence the Against All Odds Tours comes in to fill that gap, Skaiva said.Born Mqondisi Sibanda, Skaiva has three extended play projects under his name It s Love, Soulful Heaven and No Vocal.The three projects propelled him to win the best house musician of the year award at the Zimbabwe Music awards in 2015.Against All Odds becomes his debut full studio album, with 14 tracks featuring hit tracks such as Imali Yeqolo, Ayeye featuring CiJay which have been making waves on local radio stations. The album is themed along love, struggle and dance. Skaiva localised his sound and featured talented vocalist in some of the songs.
