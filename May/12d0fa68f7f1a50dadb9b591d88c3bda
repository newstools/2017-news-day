Several thousands of people were left mesmerised free of charge as Africa s cream de la cream of gospel music on Sunday lighted up the National Sports Stadium during the global Worship and Communion Service held by Christ Embassy church leader Chris Oyakhilome during his maiden visit to Zimbabwe. By Albert MasakaSinachOne of Zimbabwe s brightest prospects on the local gospel music scene Blessing Manyangadze, popularly known as Flem B, also gave a dazzling perfomance which did his country proud as he was given an opportunity to perform his new songs God s word is settled and Your Presence twice on stage as fans in the stadium clamoured for more.True to its billing as a worship and communion event, the gigantic stadium for hours reverberated to the music of the some of the continent s finest gospel artistes led by Sinach, Eben, Ada, Buchi, PU from the LoveWorld Music and Arts Ministry (LMAM) headed by Kathy Woghiren from Nigeria.Their stage acts were complemented by the worldclass stage setting and public address system that left many in awe, who attended the service which was broadcast live in many parts of the world.The introduction of the award-winning song writer, Sinach on stage by Pastor Chris towards the end of the service drew excitement from the terraces and many people who were sitted on the packed football pitch stood up to dance and wave their hands to their favourite artiste, who did not disappoint them as she produced another classic act.An excited fan who begun to shed tears as Sinach came on stage told NewsDay that she was crying out of joy as finally she was able to watch her favourite singer live as she had not been able to attend her two previous and only shows in Zimbabwe because she could not afford the entrance fees. I came as an act of faith since I had not registered, my elder sister who is also a Sinach fan could not come as she thought she would not be able to enter the stadium since she had not registered for the programme. I have failed to attend her shows in the past because I did not have the money to pay. Today I am watching her for free, this is why I am overwhelmed with joy, the young woman said, as she shied away from giving her name to NewsDay.Sinach is one of the foremost Nigerian gospel songstress signed to LoveWorld Records. Her song Way Maker is so popular in Zimbabwe that it is being played at every street corner, particularly in Harare s central business district. The award-winning song writer and music minister has blessed and inspired millions all over the world with her music. She has ministered all over the world with Pastor Chris, on whose platform several miracles were reported to have manifested by the power of God. With more than 150 songs to her credit, she testifies that her pastor s message from the Bible is the content of her music.Last on stage was Buchi, whose reggae beat blessed thousands of people who had left the terraces to go to the front of the stage in the stadium to give their lives to Christ following an alter call by Pastor Chris. Buchi has won a series of awards, including the prestigious Amen for Best in Gospel Category, Faith, Pomp and Toma Awards for Best Artist, Reggae Artiste and Gospel Album of the Year.
