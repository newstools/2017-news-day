BANTU ROVERS captain Bukhosi Sibanda, who scored a hat-trick in the 7-2 demolition of Yadah FC on Sunday taking his tally to seven goals in seven games, has shot to the top goalscorers chart in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League. BY FORTUNE MBELEBukhosi SibandaIt took last year s Golden Boot winner Leonard Tsipa 21 matches to score seven goals, but it has taken the 21-year-old just seven.The former Under-20 Young Warriors captain was over the moon after the hat-trick, the first of the season and said the seven goals they scored against Yadah FC would improve their goal difference.Reeling on position 16 on the log-table and having conceded 17 goals in seven matches, Bantu Rovers have scored the highest number of goals (12) with only two wins. I am very excited this is my first hat-trick since I started playing professional football. This is very special. I have scored seven goals so far and I will make sure I keep scoring so that we try and cushion ourselves from the goals that we have conceded, Sibanda said.Obriel Chirinda, another youngster in the Bantu ranks, provided four assists and scored a goal in that match and assistant coach Joseph Sibindi heaped praises on the two boys. We believe this will go a long way in reducing the goal difference that we have. These boys are hard workers and these are some of the efforts that they have shown on the field of play. Sibanda has leadership qualities and those characteristics are inborn. He is a level-headed boy, listens to advice and we are hopeful that we don t put him under pressure because of expectations, but try to work on his psychological aspect so that he can manage his off-field life and his life on the field of play, Sibindi said.Sibanda scored in the 3-2 defeat to FC Platinum at Maglas, then against Triangle at Luveve and also grabbed a brace in another 3-2 loss to Hwange.
