BY SILAS NKALAThembelenkosi Ndlovu of Kariyangwe in Binga was on Monday sentenced to 26 months in jail for impersonation when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Tinashe Tashaya.Ndlovu (31) apologised to the court saying the uniform had been entrusted to him for safekeeping by his police friend. I apologise that I erred your worship. The uniform belonged to my friend I was keeping it. He never gave it to me to wear.

Ndlovu was putting on a blue police anti- riot trousers with a civilian belt, grey police shirt with ZRP tittles for the ranks of an inspector, black civilian shoes and was not wearing a hat.Mhlanga then drove his kombi to Drill Hall Police Station to alert the police of the presence of a fake police officer.
