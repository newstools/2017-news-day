A FORMER Allied Timbers contract worker allegedly attempted to commit suicide by consuming rat poison at the company premises demanding his dues owed by the firm. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Pfukwa Zhakata, who is among the 65 workers camping at the company s premises, demanding their 17 months wages, was ferried to Mutare General Hospital by the company s management on Tuesday.NewsDay visited the company premises on Wednesday where the workers narrated the sad ordeal.They said Zhakata was now under the care of the management as they feared for his life.Shamiso Mafukame said the former workers were resisting to move from the company until their demands have been met. The problem started when we received a letter that we should vacate the company premises. Later on (Tuesday) the police came and threatened us with arrest if we failed to vacate the premises, he said. Zhakata was protesting and he just disappeared from the crowd. People then realised that he had earlier threatened to kill himself. He was found near the toilet with froth coming from his mouth. He admitted drinking poison. Another worker, Wellington Mashaka, said: We would rather die than be forced to vacate the premises. The company s lawyer Passmore Nyakureba was not answering his phone while a human resources officer, identified as Mr Mahara, was also not available for comment.The workers started besieging the company offices almost two weeks ago. However, this week the messenger of court handed them a court interdict barring them from continuing besieging the company premises.The workers, who have travelled long distances from Chimanimani, Gwindingwi, Erin and Stapleford, are sleeping in corridors and boardroom where they have apportioned themselves rooms and corners.
