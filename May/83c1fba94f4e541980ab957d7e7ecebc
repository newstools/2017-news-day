It is when police help was sought for that Nkomo was later found as an identified body in a police mortuary, Harrison Nkomo said.His body had deep stab wounds but his phone and other personal items were missing.The late Nkomo is one of the millions of Zimbabwean youths, who left the economically run down country to look for employment in South Africa.Many others are dotted around the world and as far afield as Canada, Australia and New Zealand to find employment.
