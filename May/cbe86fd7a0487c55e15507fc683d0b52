THE National Assembly yesterday sat for only 13 minutes, without discussing any motions listed on the order paper. BY VENERANDA LANGAMotions listed included the second reading stage of the National Peace and Reconciliation Bill, which was not discussed because Vice-President Phelekezela Mphoko was not present in the House.As soon as the House resumed, MDC-T chief whip Innocent Gonese stood up to raise a point of order pertaining to Mphoko s absence in the House after he again failed to turn up on Tuesday. At this point, I think it is important for us as representatives of the people to be apraised as to whether the VP is going to turn up or he has thumbed his nose on us showing total disdain for the institution, Gonese said.MPs on Tuesday had vowed that they would not debate the second reading stage if Mphoko and his Minister of State, Tabeth Kanengoni are not present.
