We take you through the streets of Harare, and get you to watch the state of the Sunshine City in 2017.  From spike-wielding traffic police officers on street corners, to vendors and their carts everywhere.  We also show you ‘money-changers’ and flea marketeers and more. This is just part one. Wednesday next we will show you more of Harare in our part two.
