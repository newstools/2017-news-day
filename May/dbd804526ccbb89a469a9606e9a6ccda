A BUDDING Zimbabwean gospel artiste-cum-actress based in Beitbridge, Tendai Sadzauchi, is set to storm the Zimbabwean music scene with her high energy gospel beat. BY PRECIOUS CHIDAThe mother of two, who has just released a seven-track debut album titled Yeuka, told NewsDay yesterday that she drew her inspiration from Jah Prayzah and fellow gospel diva Fungisai Zvakavapano-Mashavave. I am inspired by Jah Prayzah despite him not being a gospel singer. He has pushed himself hard to be where he is now. He is a hard worker and I love his character, Sadzauchi said. I follow him on social media and he is just everyone s fan. He has inspired me to be who I am today. Sadzauchi said she faced a lot of obstacles trying to break into the music industry. I struggled to release my album, but my husband and my parents gave me all the support. But some of my relatives couldn t accept it and they even mocked me, she said. Tracks on the album are Yeuka, Dai Jesu Achionekwa, Munhu Wenyama, Takashanda Matarenda, Eden, Hatina Musha Panyika and Mwari Makanaka.Sadzauchi said she was motivated to do a video for her lead single, Yeuka after she got positive responses from fans. I took my music to National FM and I had good responses from outside Beitbridge and from as far as Namibia, South Africa and Botswana, she said. I hope to make more videos even though it s really hard because we have no facilities to produce high quality videos in Beitbridge, but I intend to work with producers from Harare or Bulawayo. The multi-talented musician, who is also a beautician and actress, owns beauty salons in Beitbridge and has been acting in local dramas such as Kushereketa and Love and Jealous.
