Hwange . . . . . . . (0) 0 How MINE . . . . . (0) 0Hwange s barren stretch at home continued yesterday when they wer held to a draw by How Mine in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at the Colliery Stadium. By Tinashe Mungazi The coalminers have gone for 450 minutes without a goal at home.It was the gold miners who threatened to score early when Marvelous Mukumba s shot was foiled by goalkeeper Taimon Mvula.Two minutes later Mukumba attempted to slip past Chipangano defence but the ball deflected for a corner.Hwange started to creep into the match slowly and in the 15th minute a Shepard Gadzikwa s attempt near the box earned the hosts a free kick. Wilfred Munorwei took responsibility from the dead ball and it was spectacularly saved by an alert Munyaradzi Diya.How Mine could have taken the lead in the final 10 minutes of the first half through Toto Banda who failed to utilise a stray ball that had fallen into his custody close to the box sending it wide. Hwange gaffer, Nation Dube described the game as tough while bemoaning the chances his team squandered. It was a tough game indeed. There were a few chances that we could have used to get a goal otherwise we were playing against a good team, Dube said.How Mine s Kelvin Kaindu blamed fatigue for failing to take all three points. We were just average today we dropped vital points today was not good this the game that we failed even to create chance as in other games. Today we were not on the offensive because of to many games and travelling, however, we thank God for the point.
