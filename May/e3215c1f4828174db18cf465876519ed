Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare minister Priscah Mupfumira on Tuesday clashed with people living with disabilities who were resisting her calls for them to move to Ruwa Rehabilitation Centre following their eviction from Masterton Leonard Cheshire property near the central business district in Harare recently. by Vanessa GonyeMupfumira offered the evicted tenants temporary accommodation in Ruwa while her ministry was looking into their issue. I have come to plead with you. It is not respectable for you to sleep out in this cold weather, it may lead to pneumonia and other illnesses. So the Ruwa accommodation is just an interim stop-gap measure while we look into your issue as well as to find some form of income-generating projects for you, she pleaded.But some of the residents said they feared government would abandon them once they moved to Ruwa.One of the evictees, Veronica Chinyerere, accused Mupfumira of misleading the residents. We need concrete solutions to our plight. Are you ready to come and support us in court when the issue of getting money from the bogus trustees backfires? We want help so that the place is re-opened for us while we solve the matter amicably, she said.Mupfumira said Chinyerere was way too young to confront her and accusing her of lying. It is unAfrican to point fingers at elders and to say they are lying. Please learn to listen as people speak because you are misguided and wrong, Mupfumira said.
