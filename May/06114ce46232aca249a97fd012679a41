RESURGENT How Mine face former champions, Chicken Inn at Luveve Stadium tomorrow in a city derby without talisman, Toto Banda following an injury he sustained on Monday. BY FORTUNE MBELEBanda, who scored the solitary goal in the victory against Bantu Rovers and also scored the winner against Dynamos the week before in Harare, spent Monday night in hospital after he collided with Bantu Rovers defender, Dumisani Ndlovu 20 minutes before the final whistle.Coach, Kelvin Kaindu yesterday said Banda had been asked to rest by the team s medical team. He (Banda) is out of hospital, but the doctors have given him two days off and he is not available for the match on Sunday (tomorrow), he said.After a slow start to the season, where they collected just three points from as many matches, the gold miners have won three matches on the trot, beating Bantu Rovers, DeMbare and Chapungu to accumulate 10 points, two behind log-leaders Highlanders.They hope to come out with another win against the Gamecocks. Derbies are never easy games, but we have improved in the way we have played in these local derbies. Picking up maximum points in the last three games gives us the confidence and we hope we come out with positive results against Chicken Inn. But they have got their own reputation, I believe the better team of the day will win, Kaindu said.Chicken Inn, under Rahman Gumbo, have had their ups and downs, with three victories and two defeats since the league started.They clobbered Bantu Rovers 5-0 in their first league encounter, before losing to Bulawayo City to recover and beat Triangle at Gibbo.The Gamecocks lost at home to Black Rhinos before beating Hwange at the Colliery last weekend.
