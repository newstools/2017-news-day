I always write my songs imagining my sound with someone s sound and think of what we can produce after this, he said. I have heard these guys music and I really appreciate and get motivated with their art so I realise and admit that what I want cannot come out without them. He said he used the opportunity to collaborate with other artistes to draw precious lessons from their experiences. Most of the popular artistes valued my music and I used that chance to talk to them for collaborations, I want to go international as soon as possible so I have to do this now and appreciate my own Zimbabwe first before going beyond, he said.Terry Africa said he is mainly drawn to African music, especially with a Zimbabwean feel.The 24-year-old artiste now has 15 tracks and one video for his single titled African Mood. I am working hard to put Zimbabwean music on the world map, though I am still known by a small audience, he said.
