BY HENRY MHARANorman MapezaZimbabwe begin their bid for a fourth appearance at the continental football showpiece with a home date against tricky West Africans, Liberia, at the National Sports Stadium on June 11.Efforts are still being made to bring in England-born Burnley defender, Tendai Darikwa, into the Warriors fold and hopes are high he could finally feature for Zimbabwe.Announcing the 25-member squad to go into camp on Monday at the Zifa offices yesterday, Warriors manager, Wellington Mupandare, said this was not the final team, as they were still working on getting other foreign-based players. The 25 players that I am going to announce are not the final team. We are still working on the other players, especially from England like Tendai Darikwa, he might still make it, he said. Mupandare gave an update on a number of England-based players that Zifa has been courting in the past couple of weeks. The person, who is representing me in England, will have a meeting with Darikwa and his father tomorrow (today), he said. I wrote to the club and there is no problem with him. Same with (Brendan) Galloway, his club have no problem with us using him, but he has not been forthcoming because I don t have his direct number. Macauley Bonne is definitely not coming because he had booked his holiday, but I don t know what he heard about Zimbabwe, because he said he can come to South Africa, play Cosafa and go back to England, he does not want to come here. Leeroy Benyu is willing, I had a chat with his father and we are just waiting to clarify a few issues.
