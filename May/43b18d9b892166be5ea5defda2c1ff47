FORMER Warriors centre-back Zvenyika Mokenese has lined up a sensational return to Shabanie Mine when the mid-season transfer window opens. BY MUKUDZEI CHINGWERE Zvenyika MakoneseMakonese was one of the standout players for Shabanie Mine last season, helping the side to win promotion back into the country s elite league.His efforts did not go unnoticed last season as he was again voted as one of the three best players in the Central Division One League for 2016.Following his commendable efforts for a 38-year-old, the defender attracted foreign interest during off-season, but unfortunately the move failed to materialise.But now he feels he has something to offer to the game as a player, especially for his boyhood club Shabanie Mine where he feels his DNA belongs. I am starting full training this week to adequately prepare for my return next month. I wanted to be part of them from the start, but there was an offer from a foreign club which did not materialise. Now I want to continue at the club where I feel I belong, Makonese told NewsDaySport yesterday. I have watched them playing this season and the youngsters are doing very well, but I think I am still good enough to come and assist the team. I feel for the youngsters, especially in the matches they do not get the desired results. I will come with experience that will help them in matches. The technical department is doing a wonderful job considering that the coaches started working with the team late. But the technical department has made it very clear that there will be no special favours for the veteran defender.Technical manager Taku Shariwa said they would only consider adding him to the team on merit. We have an open-door policy here so anybody who comes will have to prove themselves to justify their inclusion in the team, Shariwa said.
