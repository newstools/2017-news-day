ZANU PF secretary for youth Kudzi Chipanga has urged aspiring party candidates eyeing both legislative and council posts to stop campaigning, as the party will not hold its primary elections this year. by JAIROS SAUNYAMAAddressing thousands of party youths at Mbuya Nehanda Hall in Marondera yesterday, Chipanga, who was guest of honour at the event meant to prepare for President Robert Mugabe s visit to Mashonaland East next month, said those harbouring ambitions to replace incumbent legislators should stop, at least for now. This is the message I have, there are no elections for MPs this year, there are no elections for councillors this year, take heed of that. Elections are going to be held next year, 2018. Therefore, we are against those who are already campaigning, he said. If there are people telling you that you are a suitable candidate, try in 2018, this year we are only saying President Mugabe is the only Presidential candidate. So let the incumbent candidates work for the people. To the incumbent MPs go back to the people and work for them. Chipanga warned some party members in Manicaland Province, who were already on the ground mobilising support ahead of primary elections.Chipanga also said Mugabe was life President and will lead Zanu PF and the country as long as he lives. We want people, who move around saying our only candidate is the President Mugabe. As long as he is still breathing, he will lead us, he will be our life President, he said.Mugabe will begin the meet the youths tour on June 3 at Rudhaka Stadium and not on May 20 as earlier announced. The 93-year-old leader was expected to meet party youths in all the country s 10 provinces to mobilise support ahead of next year s elections.Yesterday s event was attended by local legislators, party provincial leadership members and national youth league executive members.
