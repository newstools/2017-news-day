FORMER City of Harare treasurer Misheck Mubvumbi and four councillors yesterday appeared at the Harare Magistrates Court facing fraud allegations involving $32 million. Former town clerk Tendai Mahachi, waste water works manager Simon Takawira Muserere and director of water Christopher Magwenzi Zvobgo have also been hauled before the courts facing similar charges. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEMubvumbi (64), together with councillors Wilton Janjazi (47), Urayayi Mangwiro (42), Paula Macharangwanda (51) and former councillor Masiye Kapare (48), were not asked to plead when they appeared before provincial magistrate Barbara Chimboza, who released them to June 22 on $400 bail each.The suspects are alleged to have unprocedurally award sewerage tenders to some unregistered companies. As part of their bail conditions they were ordered to report every Friday at CID Commercial Crime Unit, to reside at their given addresses, not to interfere with State witnesses and to surrender their travel documents.According to the court papers, the complainant in the matter is City of Harare represented by acting town clerk Josephine Ncube. It is the State s case that sometime in 2010 the five suspects, acting in connivance, circumvented council tender procedures in order to smuggle in an unregistered company for the awarding of a contract for the rehabilitation of Firle Sewage Works.The State alleges the five did not follow laid-down council tender procedures and proceeded to award the contract to Energy Resources Africa Consortium.It is alleged the suspects bypassed tender sub-committees set out in terms of the council tender procedures and came up with an unpriced bill of quantities for the rehabilitation works, thereby corruptly neglecting to request the bidders to submit the required forms, certificate of incorporation, tax clearance certificate and audited financial statements, which are a prerequisite in all tenders.
