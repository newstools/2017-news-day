DESPITE the good run that has seen How Mine put together four successive wins, coach Kelvin Kaindu will take a cautious approach when the gold miners take on FC Platinum in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match this afternoon. BY FORTUNE MBELEKelvin KainduKaindu said the wins had given his charges motivation. There are only two teams that have not recorded a loss so far and we are meeting one of them tomorrow (today) and that is FC Platinum, Kaindu said. They have got pedigree, have been consistent, playing an enterprising and attacking game. I think we are going to witness a very exciting and good game. For us, it s the first time that How Mine have won four matches in a row and that gives us motivation. How Mine have the same number of points as Ngezi Platinum and Highlanders.Striker Toto Banda makes a return after missing last week s match through injury.Norman Mapeza s platinum miners are also coming from a home win against Hwange after being held by to a goalless draw by league returnees Black Rhinos in Harare.After that match, Black Rhinos take on Bulawayo City at the same venue.The soldiers are coming from another away fixture where they played a 1-1 draw with Triangle at Gibbo.Coach Stanford Mutizwa is looking forward to the match.

I am looking forward to a win, Mutizwa said.It s not looking good for Bulawayo City and coach Mandla Mpofu, who did not collect maximum points in the last four matches, losing to ZPC Kariba and Triangle and playing draws against Harare City and FC Platinum.Both matches will be beamed live on SuperSport.
