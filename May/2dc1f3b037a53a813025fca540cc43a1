More than six musicians took to the stage on the eve of Africa Day in a fundraising show for the legendary sungura icon, Tedious Matsito, who suffered a stroke in December last year while on tour in South Africa, and raised $354 from the gate takings. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDETedious MatsitoAmong the musicians, who performed at DZ Travellers Tavern in Dzivaresekwa, were Simon Mutambi, Tatenda Pinjisi, Patricia Tete Pipilo Makusha and Sam Mabukwa of the Ngosimbi Crew.Matsito performed two of his hit songs Gede Mwana Gede and Vimbiso which made him a household name, before he was escorted off stage by his aides to the revellers rousing applause.Speaking after the performance, the Manyemwe Emhuru hitmaker expressed gratitude to DZ Travellers proprietor Vincent Muzvezve and the fans, who helped raise money to buy him an artificial leg. I want to thank Muzvezve and the fans that parted with their money to help me buy my artificial leg. As you can see, my wife, Patience, is collecting gate takings (and) it shows this organisation is really for my welfare, Matsito said.Mutambi, who kept revellers on their feet with his spirited performance, told NewsDay that fundraising shows for troubled musicians must be a regular activity, as a show of unity among the entertainers. Some of the musicians lined up to perform at the show were Zakaria Zakaria, Progress Chipfumo and Freddie Kapfupi Manjalima, but they did not attend the show.Music promoters have been organising fundraising shows for Matsito, with the recent one held last week in Warren Park.In 2013, music promoter, Patson Chipaz Chimbodza organised a fundraising function for him at Gwanzura Stadium.A few weeks ago, Marondera music promoter, Daniel Masaiti also donated groceries worth hundreds of dollars to Matsito.The musician suffered a mild stroke that affected the facial nerve and has been going for speech therapy at a local medical institution, where each session costs $20.Matsito is currently staying with his wife, Patience, and five of his six children.Patience said her husband needed to attend a number of speech therapy sessions as well as money to travel to a South African hospital for a medical review.The stroke came in the wake of another misfortune when his leg was amputated after it had developed a condition called gangrene, following a road accident in 2008, where some of his band members perished.
