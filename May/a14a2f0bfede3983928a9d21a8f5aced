DYNAMOS will play their Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match against Black Rhinos on Thursday under floodlights. BY SPORTS REPORTER Dynamos coach Lloyd MutasaThe popular Harare giants are exploring ways to ensure they get a sizeable crowd and want to experiment with an evening match at the National Sports Stadium.DeMbare had proposed to have the match played at Rufaro Stadium, but Harare City Council said the stadium would not be ready.With Europa League matches now out of the way, Dynamos believe they can get the numbers since there will not be much going on elsewhere.Club committee member Graham Mafoko yesterday confirmed that the match against Rhinos would be a 7pm kick-off. We have decided to have the match under floodlights. We are looking at a situation where we think people will be busy during the day so we are likely to get a better crowd during the evening, Mafoko said. It s an important match against a team that has been doing well of late so it will have a lot of interest. In recent years local clubs have preferred to play their matches during the day unlike in the past where some of the matches took place in the evening.DeMbare have had a yoyo start to the season and while they have exhibited a lot of potential, they have lacked consistency.Their last match against Highlanders on Sunday ended prematurely following crowd trouble after Lloyd Mutasa s men had equalised.The goal triggered mayhem at Barbourfields as Bosso supporters launched a protest and subsequently threw missiles.Dynamos are perched on position 14 on the log with seven points from five matches while Rhinos have got 14 points from seven matches.
