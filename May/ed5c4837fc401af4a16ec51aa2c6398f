WINLESS Tsholotsho FC are in a rush to engage a head coach before their Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match against high-flying Ngezi Platinum tomorrow with former Bulawayo City coach Philani Beefy Ncube and Tavaka Gumbo tipped to take over from Farai Tawachera. BY FORTUNE MBELEPhilani NcubeTawachera threw in the towel on Saturday after Tsholotsho lost their fifth match of the season at Dulivhadzimo Stadium, falling to Bulawayo City 2-1.It appears Tawachera, who will still be in the technical structures, was already on his way out as club chairman Mlamuli Phiri yesterday said the board had met last week to finalise on who would take over. The board sat last week on Thursday to finalise on the next head coach among the applicants who submitted their CVs. I spoke to the director (Mandla Manyathela) last week and he said Ncube should submit his CV for consideration, but I know for certain that Gumbo tendered his. I was not part of the meeting, but whoever they have settled on will be in charge against Ngezi Platinum on Thursday (tomorrow). Tawachera has not resigned per se, but will be an assistant to the new head coach, Phiri said.England-based Tongai Dodo is also believed to be interested in the job.Phiri said they were eyeing former Bantu Rovers coach Johannes Ngodzo, but the Highlanders legend, who helped Tshintsha Guluva return to the Premier Soccer League, falls short of the prerequisite Caf A Licence badge to coach in the top-flight.The Tsholotsho FC chairman said former Highlanders midfielder Richard Choruma and ex-Hwange player Twyman Ncube had also offered to assist, while former Highlanders coach Bongani Mafu expressed interest.
