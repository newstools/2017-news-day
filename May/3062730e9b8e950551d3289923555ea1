AFTER hosting a successful launch for his debut book Winner s Code, motivational speaker and radio presenter, Thula Ndlovu says the book s reception has motivated him to work on another one. BY SINDISO DUBE Thula NdlovuThe launch, which was held early this month at Caf Munandi in Bulawayo, was attended by the who s who of the City of Kings and local authors. Winner s Code is about self-actualisation, it s a guide to discovering people or the reader s in-built potential, accentuating about habits, attitudes and traits that one has to develop in their lives in order to progress and improve their lives, he said. After the launch, I took the book to Harare, where it was received well and the next stop is probably Zvishavane and Gweru. The love and support I am receiving has motivated me to work on more books. Ndlovu said he is trying to develop himself as an individual through writing. We are living in tough times that require one to be the best of the best in order to attain success, he said. As I was following the lives of successful people, I realised that they all have traits and attitudes that they all exhibit that makes them rise in life, so I wrote the book in order for the reader to use that as a guide to success. Born in Bulawayo 26 years ago, Ndlovu is a motivational speaker and a radio presenter at Oasis Universal Radio in the United Kingdom.He is also a research specialist with a BSc honours degree in Operations Research and Statistics from the National University of Science and Technology.
