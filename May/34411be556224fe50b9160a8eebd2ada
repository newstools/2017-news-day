Top managers at Harare City Council are allegedly refusing to appear before a tribunal probing illegal payment of salaries to executives, NewsDay has learnt. BY XOLISANI NCUBEActing town clerk Josephine NcubeThe tribunal, chaired by retired High Court judge, Justice George Smith, has delayed concluding its probe due to alleged reluctance by city managers most of whom are accused of siphoning public funds at Town House to either appear before the committee or provide required information.Mayor Bernard Manyenyeni yesterday confirmed that the tribunal was finding it hard to get much-needed support from city officials and this was delaying the conclusion of the matter. It s unfortunate that the people who must provide the tribunal with information, most of them are the ones who are being investigated, and this has caused the delay, he said.The tribunal, which has two lawyers, two chartered accountants and a human resources expert, has been mandated to probe allegations that former town clerk Tendai Mahachi, acting town clerk Josephine Ncube and other directors illegally paid themselves allowances.Ncube and other city executives could not be reached for comment as they were said to be in a meeting.Late last year, Manyenyeni suspended Ncube to allow investigations to take place in her absence.But Ncube was reinstated by Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere, who urged council to find a better way of dealing with the issue without resorting to suspensions.The probe was set up after a government audit unearthed massive financial irregularities at the local authority.The government audit revealed that Mahachi and six other senior council officials claimed more than $1 million through dubious allowances and perks, while the rest of the workforce had not been paid.The Combined Harare Residents Association yesterday said council s top executives were defying a directive to appear before the tribunal and this was a cause for concern among ratepayers. Such open defiance by the city top executives points to organised crime at the Harare City Council, which should be thoroughly investigated, after which the law should take its course, the residents body said in a statement. Corruption, financial mismanagement and abuse of office have become the norm at the Harare City Council and the development has cost the city millions of dollars at a time effective service delivery is at its low.
