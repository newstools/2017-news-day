I just told my players that we can not lose to a team I have once coached. But overally we played well and hope for maximum points in our next game, Chikuni said.Host coach Takesure Chiragwi was happy also with a point against the army side. I am very happy with the application of the players they played very well, the only problem was that we failed to score. It is a point gained, Chiragwi said.Former Dynamos striker Farai Mupasiri gave the visitors all sorts of problems and his effort crashed against the woodwork as early as the third minute.Three minutes later his effort was again tipped over the bar by the visiting goalie.After an hour of action the army side had to take care for cover in true military style when a swam of bees passed through the pitch. Twenty minutes before full time Mupasiri got behind the defence again but his effort was wide off goal.
