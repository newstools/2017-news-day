My fans are just humbling. We are growing into a loving family, and each time they discover that one of our family members is in a situation that needs support, they inform each other and alert me, he said. We don t just stop with Zora fans. We reach out to other persons in need outside the Zora family. Of course, the resource base is small, but we try to do our best. Loveness expressed gratitude to Zhakata and Zora music fans for chipping in to assist her family. What I earn from my clothes vending enterprise is not enough to sustain the family, and unexpectedly, Zora fans came to the rescue, she said. Today s donation of a wheelchair is a pleasant and timely surprise as my husband is no longer able to move on his own. Kisimisi, who has been an ardent Zora fan since 1990, says the song that cemented his relationship with Zora music was Nhamodzenyika.Zhakata has penned many songs that encourage helping those in need, among them is his song Chido Ndinacho.
