A POPULAR Mutare prophet has warned that many politicians will suffer humiliating defeats in next year s elections, while accusing them of seeking help from witchdoctors instead of God. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Speaking during his church s service at the weekend, Revival Centre World Mission leader Adventure Mutepfa said some politicians were living in a dark world, as they were seeking powers from witchdoctors to maintain their hold on power. I m not a politician, but I have something that I want you (congregants) to advise them. My advice to them (politicians) is that they must begin to seek men of God. We are raised to help them. All kings, if you follow the Bible, for a King to be there, they need a prophet. So politicians must also emulate what was done in the olden days, he said. They must not run to witchdoctors because there will be confusion. Zimbabwe needs light and the only way they can achieve that is by seeking prophets advice and they will be delivered. If they fail to take my advice, some of them (politicians) are going to suffer humiliating and shocking defeats in next year s elections.
