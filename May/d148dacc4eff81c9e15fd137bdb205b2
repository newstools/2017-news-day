THE premiere of a new weekly television pan-African magazine show Thatha Wena on ZBC television last week hosted by Gilmore Tee and Mbo Mahocs has brought a new lease of life to the small screen. BY SINDISO DUBEGilmore Tee (left) and Mbo MahocsThe show which will be broadcast at 5:30pm every Thursday, encourages people to take control of their areas of influence and make things happen for themselves and not wait for someone to come and initiate positive ideas for them.Those who were watching ZBCTV may have been tempted to double check their television sets thinking they had mistakenly switched to a South African channel, for a talk show such as Expresso due to the high quality of production and how the hosts articulate themselves.So profound, natural and fluent the fashionable hosts went through the show s three informed segments filled with glitz and glamour.The show s first guests were arts journalist and musician, Admire Kudita, also known as Kay and Bulawayo s artiste Mazilankatha.With three segments, What Grinds My Gears is one of the more exciting which is a thought-provoking segment of each episode, allowing one person to highlight what annoys them about the ill-behaviours of society. The idea of this segment is to challenge societal change towards the positive on and offline, it carries the simple, but important aspects of everyday life or human behaviour that if either changed or implemented can develop our society towards the better, Gilmore Tee said. We seek to tap into the mind-set of our continents drivers on issues and topics are necessary to building our country and continent using television. The show s production team, which started working on the concept in 2015, comprises of Mbo Mahocs, Nka Malunga, Johane Mpofu, Tswarelo Mothobe and Gilmore Tee.
