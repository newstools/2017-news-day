LEGISLATIVE watchdog, Veritas has urged Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda to issue a statement calling on the Justice and Legal ministry to show cause on accelerating the alignment of the country s laws to the Constitution. By NQOBANI NDLOVUSpeaker of the National Assembly Jacob MudendaThe country adopted a new Constitution in 2013 and this has necessitated that several laws be aligned to the new charter.The process is, however, moving at a snail s pace, a situation Veritas said will render the Constitution a waste of time and fraud against long suffering Zimbabweans.Veritas said the government has a duty to ensure the alignment process is done and expedited, but also noted that Parliament had a role to play to also pressure the Executive. Perhaps the Speaker could issue a statement calling on the government to carry out its duty towards the people of Zimbabwe by accelerating the alignment of our laws, thereby, making the Constitution an effective, living document, the body said. The Constitution took years of resources and manpower in its making. If is not properly and timeously implemented all this effort will have been not only a waste of time, but a deception and fraud perpetrated on the people of Zimbabwe and the international community. Analysts have said Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa s dual roles as the Justice minister and a member of the presidium is delaying the alignment process due to the heavy workload, but Veritas said that is not an excuse. It must be recognised by all that the Constitution is the supreme law and overrides all other laws, and alignment is part of the process to see that the Constitution is implemented, the legal watchdog said. Our laws are valid only to the extent that they comply with the Constitution. No matter how laborious the alignment process, the government must expedite it, and Parliament should pressure it to do so.
