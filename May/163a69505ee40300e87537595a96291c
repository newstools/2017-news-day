However, we celebrate the ConCourt [Constitutional Court] ruling that specifies that the age of marriage is 18, Chikwinya said.Child brides has remained a challenge in Southern Africa, with empirical evidence showing that children are married off for financial gain.Poverty-stricken families are likely to marry off their daughters early in a bid to escape from poverty. Another issue which Chikwinya raised was that of human trafficking. We are seized with this issue and young women have fallen prey to this, she said, adding she was confident that families had the capacity to address these issues.Meanwhile, Chikwinya said the intended setting-up of a micro-finance bank for women would empower them economically.Family Day is a United Nations initiative and is celebrated every year on May 15. The day is important for us since it attaches great importance to the family as the nuclear unit of any society, Chikwinya said.Part of the theme for this year is Education, Families and Well-Being. It is a befitting theme because education remains a basic requirement for socio-economic development, the minister said.
