FC PLATINUM coach Norman Mapeza has conceded that his team is still a work in progress ahead of the 2017 Premier Soccer League (PSL) season which is set to kick off next month. BY FORTUNE MBELENorman MapezaThe platinum miners were given a 3-0 hiding by Highlanders in the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) Charities semi-final at Luveve Stadium on Sunday.Mapeza s side, who had a training camp in South Africa last month, also struggled against top-flight returnees Shabanie Mine in the CG Msipa Charity Cup last week only to win the tournament in 4-1 in a penalty shootout.After losing to Highlanders on Sunday, Mapeza, touted to take over the Warriors coaching job, indicated that there were areas that he needed to rectify at the Zvishavane-based side, but he was happy with the fitness levels of his boys. For us it s still work in progress. Our defenders played too wide apart and made it easy for Highlanders to beat us on the counter-attack especially on the second goal, Mapeza side. But this gives us the opportunity to go back to the drawing board to rectify some of our mistakes from what I have seen today. I think in two to three weeks everything will be fine with us. In terms of positional discipline I think we are still far. We played well, but we are not going forward. Otherwise so far so good, Mapeza said.Brett Amidu, who replaced by Gerald Takwara in the 60th minute, displayed some flashes of brilliance in midfield playing more on the attack and Mapeza was impressed with his new acquisitions that also included Gift Mbweti, signed from Hwange, and Talent Chawapiwa, snatched from ZPC Kariba.Last term FC Platinum finished second behind champions Caps United in the PSL and this year they will start as one of the favourites again after some business in the transfer market, which has seen them strengthen although they also lost one of their best players from last season, Walter Musona, who is now based in South Africa.
