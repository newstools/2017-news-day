BULAWAYO s sole comedy club, Umahlekisa, celebrates its fourth anniversary in style tonight with performances from Q the Boss who scooped the outstanding comedian award at the 2017 National Arts Merit Awards Ntando van Moyo, Babongile Skhonjwa, Marcus, Miss Dee and HO at the Bulawayo Rainbow Hotel. BY SINDISO DUBEThe comedy club was established by comedian Moyo and Clive Chigubhu in 2013 with a mission of growing comedy, an entertainment discipline which had for a long time been sidelined from the mainstream arts in the country. From humble beginnings, the club started off performing in bars and restaurants before moving to Rainbow Cinemas, and eventually Rainbow Hotel, which has become their permanent home. It was hard starting the initiative in Bulawayo. We kept changing venues in search of an appropriate one and now we settled, Van Moyo said. Many people didn t like the idea of watching comedy being performed by locals yet they watch international comedy on television, we are happy that the crowd has grown and Bulawayo has been supportive towards our course. We couldn t be here if it wasn t for the support of everyone. The comedian revealed that the club was turning a new leaf this year. We are looking forward to the celebrations as we launch new partnerships from some corporates. We will also be celebrating the birth of new collaborations that will see us work and tour with most of Zimbabwe s major comedy movements like Simuka and Bus Stop TV, he said. Renowned comedians including Carl Joshua Ncube, Doc Vickella and Chigubhu have graced the Umahlekisa stage.Umahlekisa has also featured at Bulawayo s biggest arts festival Intwasa Arts festival KoBulawayo.The club has groomed comedians such as Long John, Miss Dee and Mandla.
