He later confirmed with NewsDay: Uthando was inspired by real life issues that I faced. I was in love with this girl in Bulawayo and then later found out that I was not the only man in her life. so I walked out of the relationship. I was hurt, but directed my frustration into the studio. Music is the only way I express my feelings and how I share my life stories, that s why I even called it Uthando (A Short Love Story). Cal_vin has taken it upon himself to sell the album on the streets of Bulawayo, a campaign which has paid dividends. I am my own salesman. I sell my own CDs in the streets and Uthando has been selling like hot cakes. That s why I said I am making money as a singer, he said. It s been doing well and I wish everyone would continue with the support they have showed. I really appreciate it.
