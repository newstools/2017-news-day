SOUTH AFRICA-BASED Zimbabwean musician Rich Forbes, real name Buttler Mugadza s second music video Turn Up My Level, has made it on two of Africa s prestigious television channels MTV Base and Channel O. By Sindiso DubeRich ForbesTurn Up My Level is a typical club song, which talks of having a good time and pulling the vibe of joy.Turn Up My Level was launched on Christmas Eve last year before the artiste submitted it for consideration on the television channels that have since embraced his creative works. The music video was shot in Cape Town in a ghetto set-up, with beautiful women. I am overwhelmed by how the video has propelled in the music industry, it means a lot to be recognised on such a big platform (Channel O and MTV Base) and for a Zimbabwean like me it s a big deal, Rich Forbes said. I feel like the whole nation is rallying behind me, as I have exported the culture and our local music across the continent. The young musician, who is inspired by new age rappers Emtee and Cassper Nyovest, released his debut single Paper Money, which has received favourable airplay on local radio stations and Turn Up My Level is his eighth single. After making waves, I think its high time I come up with a full album. I have done much of the ground work and I promise fans that it will drop at the end of the year and it will feature South African artistes in a bid to exchange cultures and skill, he said.Born in Mufakose 24 years ago, the musician went to Apex College for his high school, before moving down south in 2012, where he is based.
