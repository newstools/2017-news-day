FIRED Gweru mayor, Hamutendi Kombayi, who was recently fired by Local Government minister, Saviour Kasukuwere will appeal against the decision at the High Court, the Southern Eye has established. by Stephen ChadengaHamutendi KombayiLast month, Kasukuwere fired Kombayi and Ward 4 councillor, Kenneth Sithole on charges of abuse of office among others, but reinstated 10 councillors from MDC-T and three from Zanu PF.Kombayi s charges included authorising payment of $1 875 towards MDC-T leader, Morgan Tsvangirai s stay at Antelope Park and refusing to surrender his mayoral vehicle, a Mazda BT50, to council after he was suspended.But Kombayi&#8217;s lawyer, Brian Dube said they were preparing papers to make an appeal for review of the decision made by the tribunal against Kombayi.&#8220;The decision by the tribunal was atrocious and selective and by Tuesday (today) we will present our appeal for review of both conviction and the move to relieve the former mayor of his duties,&#8221; Dube said yesterday.Kombayi and other Gweru urban councillors were initially suspended in 2015, before they appealed and won a High Court reprieve, which Kasukuwere defied.Instead, the minister appointed a three-member caretaker commission, led by Tsunga Mhangami, to run council affairs, pending the findings of the tribunal investigating the councillors.Meanwhile, councillors are expected to choose a new mayor and his deputy this week, with Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions central region boss, Charles Chikozho tipped to assume the post.Sources also said ward 5 councillor, Simon Chapukira (Zanu PF), is also interested in the top job. Kasukuwere has reportedly already given greenlight to council for the payment of the reinstated councillors outstanding allowances including for the period they were on suspension.
