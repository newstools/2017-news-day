HIGHLANDERS head coach Erol Akbay believes Caps United s participation in the Caf Champions League competition gives them a competitive edge over his side, as the two giants prepare for the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) Charities Shield final set for Bulawayo on Sunday. BY FORTUNE MBELEElroy Akbay.The Green Machine are going into the match on the back of a historic qualification for the Champions League group stage, earned at the expense of TP Mazembe at the weekend.Caps United held the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) champions nil-all in the first round second leg at the National Sports Stadium on Sunday, to go through on the away goals rule, having drawn 1-1 in the first leg away in Lubumbashi last week.Akbay whose side beat FC Platinum 3-0 to book a ticket into the final, believes the Lloyd Chitembwe-coached side s participation and success in Africa s premier club competition, where they also booted Lioli FC of Lesotho in the preliminary round, puts them well ahead of everyone else in their pre-season preparations. Look, we have played two matches and playing against a side that has been competitive in the Caf Champions League that puts them in a better place than us. But anything can happen in football. If my boys play the way they did against FC Platinum I think it will be good, Akbay said.Highlanders started their training a bit late, but still managed to go for camp in South Africa where they played some competitive matches, before hosting Zambian champions Zanaco in another practice match, losing 2-1.But it is the virtuous performance of his boys, in particular new boy Roderick Mutuma who combined well with Prince Dube, in the annihilation of FC Platinum, which gives him a ray of hope of a good result on Sunday. We still have a few new guys in our team. It will be too early to rate ourselves for the league. It s a charity match in pre-season and we are still trying out combinations, he said.Akbay could also use the match to test his two foreign strikers Manuel Esono Obiang Buale from the Equatorial Guinea and DRC s Tambwe Kalunga, subject to the availability of work permits.Former Caps United player Yves Ebabali has also surfaced at Bosso, although it is not clear if the Dutchman is interested in the winger. The clubs are using the match to prepare for the league programme, which is set to kick-off at the start of next month.
