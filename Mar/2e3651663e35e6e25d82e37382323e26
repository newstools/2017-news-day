PROLIFIC writer Charles Mungoshi s family says they have made significant headway in their fundraising efforts to finance the ailing author s urgent repeat medical operation, which requires $9 000, after the first procedure failed. BY PHILLIP CHIDAVAENZICharles MungoshiThe need to repeat the surgery arose after it was realised that a shunt inserted by doctors at a government hospital to drain water from the 69-year-old Mungoshi s brain was dysfunctional.The author s eldest son, Farai, told NewsDay yesterday that they had received a positive response to their SOS and were hoping that the multiple award-winning author would go for the operation at the end of the month. We are currently in the process of raising the money and our hope is that by March 28, we would have reached the target. We are a moving by faith. So far there has been progress because of the positive response, he said.Mungoshi s wife, Jesesi, recently expressed gratitude to all the people who had chipped in to assist against an austere economic backdrop.Jesesi s Australia-based sister, Fungisai Siggins, has launched a GoFundMe campaign as part of the spirited fund-raising efforts in partnership with ZimboJam, University of Zimbabwe lecturer Memory Chirere and others.In April 2010, Mungoshi suffered from a stroke, which nearly paralysed him and led him into a two-month long comma.The author published Branching Streams Flow in the Dark in 2013, bringing to 16 the total number of books he has published between 1970 and 2013, including novels, plays, short story and poetry collections in both Shona and English. The 2017 edition of the National Arts Merit Awards (Nama) held last month were a bitter-sweet moment for the family, as Jesesi won the award for Outstanding Actress for her role in Muzita Rababa, while Farai scooped the gong in the Outstanding First Published Work with his debut short story collection, Behind the Wall Everywhere. Mungoshi, who received an honorary doctorate Doctor of Letters degree from the University of Zimbabwe in 2003 in recognition of his contribution to Zimbabwe literature, has won several awards, including International PEN Awards (1975, 1981 and 1998), Noma Honourable Awards For Publishing in Africa (1980, 1984, 1990 and 1992), Commonwealth Writer s Prize for Best Book in Africa (1988), seven awards at the Zimbabwe International Book Fair s 75 Best Books in Zimbabwe for seven of his publications and the Nama Silver Jubilee Award (2006).
