ZANU PF youths in Harare yesterday deposed a petition seeking the removal of their chairman Edson Takataka over a litany of allegations emanating from the recently, held 21st February Movement celebrations in Matobo. BY OBEY MANAYITISome youths were left stranded in Matobo without food and shelter after travelling from Harare on the promise that everything was in place.Although Takataka was not picking his calls, provincial secretary for administration Tawanda Kadengu confirmed the development.He said 33 members of the youth league signed the petition against Takataka s leadership. Thirty-three members signed a petition against the outgoing chairman on allegations that he unfairly treated youth league members to and from Matopos, Kadengu said. Many youths were stranded at the party office here in Harare without transport. He failed to organise the trip and instead went into hiding when we were looking for him. He said there was no adequate accommodation and food for the youths. We only got help after youths protested in Bulawayo forcing our national commissar Innocent Hamandishe to intervene and attend to our issues. We have totally lost confidence in him (Takataka) and his deputy Doubt Mhike is taking over, Kadengu said.Takataka took over from Godwin Gomwe, who was sacked on allegations of abusing First Lady Grace Mugabe s name in order to grab prime residential stands in Harare.
