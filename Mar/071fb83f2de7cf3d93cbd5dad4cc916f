FINANCIAL statements presented to court in the ongoing trial of a senior Zimbabwe Republic Police officer were under-done a witness told a court last week. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDESibonile Kamupira, the lawyer representing suspended police Assistant Commissioner Fortunate Chirara, who is accused of stealing $500 from Kuyedza Women s Club, a club of the wives of the police officers residing in camps through out Zimbabwe, grilled the police chief internal auditor a Superintendent Musona, accusing him of supplying the court with confusing and unfinished financial audit report. Musona admitted he had not followed internal procedures in coming up with the report and confirmed that while carrying out the audit that nailed Chirara, officials had not reconciled the cash on hand, did not verify financial books and records and did conduct an audit exit meeting with Chirara.Superintendant Musona was at pains to link Marblegold (Pvt) Limited, which is wholly-owned by top cops to Kuyedza Club. He also refused to read out the names of Marblegold shareholders among whom are Commissioner General of Police Augustine Chihuri s wife Isabel, Assistant Commissioner Justice Chengeta s wife Miriam Maidei and Support Unit boss Mekia Tanyanyiwa s wife Clara.But Musona claimed payments made to the company from Kuyedza were above board because they had Isabel s consent.As Kamupira poked holes into the State s case and queried the authenticity of the report, Musona said he was not sure if the $500 receipt, which is being used to accuse Chirara of theft had been picked from the audit.The audit report presented in court showed funds which were withdrawn from Kuyedza club which includes $40 000 to buy food stuffs on August 18 2014, $9 900 for the purchase of mattresses on August 24. Chirara is denying the charges, arguing the money which she is alleged to have stolen was in actual fact withdrawn at the instruction of Isabel Chihuri for the registration of a private company.Magistrate Ruvetsa remanded Chirara to March 10 for continuation of trial.Chirara stands accused of converting to her own use $4500 belonging to Kuyedza Club, after receiving it on October 21 last year. She had been asked to pay the Register of Companies and Agricultural Marketing Authority.Netsai Mushayabasa was prosecuting for the State.
