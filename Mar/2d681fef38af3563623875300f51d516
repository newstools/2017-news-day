DISCLOSURES by former Vice-President Joice Mujuru that male chauvinism within Zanu PF played a central role in her ejection from the governing party could be merely symptomatic, speaking to a far much wider and deeper problem of the subjugation of women that has permeated almost every facet of our society. Comment: NewsDay EditorRegardless of who is the victim, this clearly is hindering the development and empowerment of women.One can only appreciate that many women in the political and corporate facets of society aspire to climb the ladder to the top. But, as Mujuru reveals, they have to contend with a litany of bottlenecks that often break their stride to the top.The majority of men, hewn in a traditionally patriarchal society, probably need cultural re-orientation to appreciate that women can put in as much work as their male counterparts. Societies around the world have progressed and accepted that people particularly professionals cannot be viewed through the gender lenses, but the quality of work that they put in.Traditionally, women have merely been viewed as sexual objects and tales have been told of how female combatants were routinely abused during the liberation war and how, in post-independence Zimbabwe, many qualified women have had to offer sexual favours in exchange for jobs and promotion. But as we celebrate International Women s Day this month of March, there is need for society and the country s leadership to seriously relook at this culture of abuse of women.It is about time women were given their rightful place alongside their male counterparts and be treated with respect and dignity as provided for in the Constitution. The time for viewing and interpreting people through the prism of gender is long past. Only the wise will appreciate the value that women will bring to society once they are given equal opportunities and fair treatment.In several countries around the world, women have been elected presidents, while some are steering major corporates as managers and chief executives, demonstrating that capacity is not gender-based. We believe looking at females as lesser beings has perpetuated the culture of abuse and violence against women the world over.But now is the time to draw the line in the sand and make room for a new culture and dispensation in which women are viewed as equals in terms of what they can offer society at large. This, however, can only happen when women close ranks and work together rather than use the pull-her-down syndrome, to which Mujuru attributed her downfall in Zanu PF and government following First Lady Grace Mugabe s vilification campaign against her.
