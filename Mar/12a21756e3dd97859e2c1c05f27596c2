He is riding high following the release of his DVD album titled Mabasa aMwari.The musician is set use the opportunity to sample a few tracks from his forthcoming album set for release next month. With two albums under his belt, Moyo is expected to go down memory lane and belt out tracks such as Muchina Muhombe, Samanyemba and Ganda Remvura, which made his father a household name on the music scene.On the other hand, Bontoman (real name Innocent Chinyani), who released his fourth album titled MaVendor late last year, is no push over when it comes to entertaining people.The Uzumba-born crooner, who has been labelled a Jah Prayzah copycat, has not disappointed either when it comes to live performances.
