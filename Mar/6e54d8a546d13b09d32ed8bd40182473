BULAWAYO gospel musician Sakhile Mthombeni, popularly known as Sakhi, says she has been amazed by how her debut album, Haven t You Heard?, has been received after its release last month. BY OWN CORREPSONDENT Sakhile MthombeniThe eight-track album, which consists of songs Long Dream, Share With Me, True Friend, At Your Feet, God s Love, Trust and No Mercy, was recorded by Joe Maseko at The House of Rising Sound Studios.Sakhi told NewsDay that she would start producing the videos of the album next month. I didn t expect it to be received like this, considering that this is my first solo effort. All these years, I have been a backing vocalist for different artistes. I then saw it fit to push my solo career as well through the experience and lessons I got from being a backing artiste, she said.Sakhi said through her music, she wanted to prod people into reflecting about problems of life and the second coming of Jesus Christ. I am asking people if they have heard about the Lord s second coming, have they seen that the world is turning into something that can devour us with incurable diseases, high crime rates, child abuse, wars between nations, civil strife, false prophets and murderers among other bad things that signal the end of the world, she said. The Bulawayo-born and raised musician said she uses gospel music as a form of prayer and worship to God. I chose gospel music because I want to worship God and I can only do that through music and the only genre that enables me to do that is gospel music, she said.
