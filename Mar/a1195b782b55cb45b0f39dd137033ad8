We use the mbira and keyboard as a base for composing all our songs. We derived our band name, Were, from the word mawere, to loosely mean we are a force to reckon, the band leader, Muzira, said. We play an intoxicating fusion of tribal and contemporary African music, which always engages the audience. We blend modern and traditional instruments, using the mbira and shakers, paired with tearing vocals to create an energetic stage performance. The female vocalists incorporate a variety of percussion instruments such as congas, mbira and hosho into repertoires that are deeply rooted in traditional Zimbabwean sounds, he said.
