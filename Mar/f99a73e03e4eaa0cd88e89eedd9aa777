CBZ Holdings chief executive, Never Nyemudzo said the bank would do everything to make the project a success, but stressed the need for government to support the initiative. The success of this project depends on the guaranteed rate of return and security of investment and for this government support is paramount. The bonds would need a government guarantee, should be given prescribed asset status and a national project status, Nyemudzo said.The deal would bring a substantial windfall to CBZ if successfully done. CBZ will receive 1,5% as commission of the amount raised and during the feasibility studies all costs would be on a tab basis to the ministry, Nyemudzo said.The advisory services agreement is for one year with an option for renewal by mutual agreement.
