I had the pleasure of meeting him and he is an amazing person. He was very humble, motivating and polite. He also answered a lot of questions from the audience regarding his life career, which is equally inspiring, she said.The event was organised by a company called Fighter UK to raise money for charity, but guests were able to meet Mayweather. My team and I networked with many corporate people and millionaires, but also took care of Floyd and his team and helped with the auctioning on stage, raising a lot of money, she said.
