HWANGE Colliery Company has been dragged to the High Court by a local plant equipment supplying company, FSI Trading, which is seeking to recover an outstanding $17 000 from a $46 000 debt obtained four years ago. BY CHARLES LAITONAccording to the equipment supplying firm, the outstanding amount is emanating from the various plant equipment which include skid tanks, oil dispensing pumps, piping, computer software and installation labour that was supplied on credit to the mining company. The total invoice presented to the defendant (Hwange) was $47 000 dated February 20, 2014 of which the defendant paid, as part settlement, an amount of $20 000 on March 21, 2014 and a further $10 000 on April 9, 2014 leaving a balance of $17 000, FSI Trading said in its declaration.FSI further said it was a material term of the agreement that Hwange Colliery Company would pay off any amounts owing in respect of the items supplied on credit after having received the goods. The defendant has breached the terms of the credit facility by failing to pay all moneys due to plaintiff after having received goods on credit and subsequently failing to honour the several demands made to it. The amount owing currently stands at $17 000, the firm said. Despite several demand and several requests, the defendant has failed, neglected or deliberately refused to pay the said amounts due. Hwange Colliery Company however has since entered an appearance to defend and is geared to defend the claim as and when the matter would be set down for hearing.
