Jibilika Dance Trust is a big organisation and my role is not an easy task, but I am determined and passion-driven to make an impact at Jibilika and to play an important role in the arts as an agent for change in societies recognisable and appreciated, she said.

Locally, I hope to steer Jibilika to reach the marginalised areas that have not been explored before as a way of identifying and uplifting talent from the grassroots level.
