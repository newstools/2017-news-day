AFTER washing the dirty linen of their alleged sex shenanigans in public, raunchy dancer Beverly Sibanda and married contemporary musician Andy Muridzo will rekindle their romance albeit on stage at sungura godfather Nicholas Zakaria s album launch on April 1 at Aquatic Complex in Chitungwiza. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOBev SibandaZimbabwe Business and Arts Hub (Zibah), which is behind the launch, has contracted the duo for the potentially explosive event.The accusations and counter-accusations that followed social media claims the two were an item saw them breaking off their stage romance.Muridzo, who denied allegations of unprotected sex that reportedly resulted in Bev getting pregnant, however, admitted he once dated the popular dancer.The developments brought an end to their regular joint shows around the country.Bev s manager Hapaguti Hapaz Mapimhidze said they would be attending the show as a way of showing unity and solidarity among musicians. We welcome the promoters gestures for bringing Bev and The Sexy Angels alongside Andy Muridzo at this special event as they overlooked what happened between the two artistes in the past. This is good for the industry and shows professionalism on the side of the promoters uniting artistes, Hapaz said. We used to have a good working relationship with Andy Muridzo before when we were being booked for joint shows and hopefully will be able to stage shows together again since that is what brings food to the table. Zakaria will also be joined at the launch by several musicians including Progress Chipfumo, Tryson Chimbetu, Cindy Munyavi as well as Charles and Olivia Charamba.Zakaria s latest six-track album, Takomborerwa, which is his 27th studio album, will be launched after it had been deferred on several occasions owing to financial constraints.On the latest album, Zakaria has collaborated with his former guitarists Macheso, after they split two decades ago, younger brother Zakaria Zakaria and fellow sungura musician Simon Mutambi.Macheso is featured on two tracks, playing the bass guitar on song Mira Pako and adds his vocals on a Chewa track, Mwambo (Law), while Mutambi is featured on Sarudzo.Zibah chairperson Takemore Mazuruse said preparations for the launch were at an advanced stage. We are happy with the preparations for the launch and we are calling for both music fans and promoters to come in their numbers this Saturday for the great launch at Aquatic Complex in Chitungwiza, he said.
