Collaborations bring new dimensions to artistes careers and this is an important project that has seen us exchanging a lot of ideas with those musicians I collaborated with, he said. I have worked with various musicians in many projects and have realised that, besides giving audiences variety, collaborations unite artistes. The Chisikana Changu Zimbabwe hitmaker said although the title of the album, Godobori, was derived from a nickname from clients, it also reflects on his musical journey. I was in the studio helping some clients how to write songs and play instruments and they were amazed with my talent that they christened me Godobori, he said. For me, this title also signifies the years of hard work I have taken to perfect my works to be the musician I am today. Songs on the album are Mari, Ndinokakama, Ngirozi, Mweya wechiZimba, Godobori, Dzoka Kumba (featuring Cynthia Mare), Chikwambo and Higher, where he featured Shinsoman.There is also Unorema, Mafans Angu Dairai and Dzefunde, which songbird Pah Chihera featured.Mpofu has worked with different artistes both locally and internationally, on different projects that included the Green Concert, that serves as an environmental awareness campaign through music.Albums under his sleeve are Handizirini, a 2010 production, Dr Philosophy and Diplomatic Alliances, released in 2013 and 2015 respectively.
