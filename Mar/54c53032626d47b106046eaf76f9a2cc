ENERGETIC musician and dancer Sandra Ndebele has marked her comeback onto the music stage with a smashing video for her latest track, Ingoma, featuring Afro-pop musician Mzoe7. BY SINDISO DUBESandra NdebeleThe new track was produced by top producer Oskid and was premiered on Wednesday morning on Vuka-Vuka Breakfast Show on Skyz Metro before migrating to YouTube.The video was directed by National Arts Merit Awards (Nama) award-winning music video producer Andy Cutta. We played around the names Ingoma which means a song or a drug in IsiNdebele and ngoma is Shona for drum or the same drug. That makes the song interesting, as the listener has to interpret it in their own way which suits them best, Ndebele said.Sandy, as Ndebele is affectionately known, revealed that the song and video were just a preview of what was to come, as she strengthened her position as the queen following the arrival of stiff competition in the mould of Bev Sibanda, Zoey and Lady Storm. I am back to rock the stage again. I have lots of new stuff and new energy to give. I will be dropping single after single and this new video is just the beginning fans should expect more stunning visuals, she said.Ndebele recently hogged the limelight at the 2017 edition of the Nama were her dress style raised eyebrows. She was one of the nominee announcers during the awards night. Away from the stage, Ndebele has been busy, too, passing her Ordinary Level mathematics examinations and enrolling at a university to further her education, while juggling a busy schedule as a wife and mother.
