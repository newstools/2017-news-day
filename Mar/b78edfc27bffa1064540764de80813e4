ARTISTES including Leonard Karikoga Zhakata, Edith WeUtonga, Eve Kawadza, Forward Mazuruse and Larry Gunda are expected to headline a gala organised by Fagio Marowa as part of a fundraising campaign to purchase shoes for underprivileged children in rural communities. BY PRECIOUS CHIDA Eve KawadzaKawadza is spearheading the campaign on social media platforms. Marowa told NewsDay yesterday that during his school days, he had first-hand experience of going to school on bare feet. He said the campaign has so far acquired 420 pairs of shoes, which were donated to Kaseke Primary School in Murewa and some children in Waterfalls and Highfield. We have decided to do a (music) gala which is going to be free of charge at Kingstons House by the end of March.Audiences are only expected to come and donate shoes, most preferably school shoes, he said.Kawadza said she developed the passion to assist underprivileged children because of her personal experiences. Growing up in Mbare and seeing these kids everyday has made me develop a passion to take part in such programmes, she said.According to Marowa, a number of individuals, corporates, churches, non-governmental organisations, government officials, artistes and businesspeople have shown their interest in the initiative. With the help of the community at large, I am sure that our campaign will be a success, he said.The people, who volunteer to partner in the campaign are to receive a few benefits at the gala which are classified in three stages silver, gold and platinum.Partners are going to be given a stand to display, market and sell their products and also a certificate of appreciation.
