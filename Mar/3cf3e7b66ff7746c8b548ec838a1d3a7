FOUR Zimbabwe golfers will line up against some of the continent s finest players when the country hosts the Africa Golf Confederation Junior Golf Team Championship, which will run from March 27 to 31 at the picturesque Royal Harare Golf Club. BY DANIEL NHAKANISOThe competition, which doubles as the continental qualifier for the Toyota Junior Golf World Cup to be held in Japan later this year, is set to be the biggest since the inaugural edition in 1995, with 17 countries having confirmed their participation.This year s event will run concurrently with the Africa Golf Confederation Junior Girls Championship, where nine countries will battle it out for the coveted title, which was hosted by Zambia and won by Zimbabwe last year.The Zimbabwe Ladies Golf Union (ZLGU) yesterday named a three-member team which includes Danielle Bekker, Emily Jones and Rumbidzai Chisango for the tournament, while the four-member boys team will be announced later this week.The boys team will be selected from a group of six players namely David Amm, Tafadzwa Nyamukondiwa, Justin Kirsten, Thompson Masiya, Tinaye Chatambudza and William Geach, who are currently in camp in preparation for the tournament.Zimbabwe Junior Golf Association official Simon Murungweni yesterday told NewsDay Sport that they were expecting some tough competition for the title from South Africa. The competition is going to be tough, as you know South Africa have traditionally dominated junior and amateur tournaments. Nevertheless, we are optimistic and we will keep our heads high. The main target for both teams is to secure qualification for the Toyota Junior Golf World Cup, Chigorimbo said. The format of the 72-hole championship is stroke play, with the best three scores per country to count towards their total in each round.The country with the lowest gross score over the four rounds will be the continental champions, while there is also a prize for the best individual gross score.Many African golf professionals on the various tours around the world have participated in the tournament over the years and some are well-known personalities including major tournament winners.The inaugural Africa Golf Confederation Junior Golf Team Championship (then known as the All-Africa Junior Golf Championship) was won by Zimbabwe in 1995.South Africa then won the tournament in 1996 and 1997, before Zimbabwe again won in 1998.However, since then South Africa have won every edition of tournament as Zimbabwe s juniors have played second fiddle to their counterparts from across the Limpopo. Last year, the tournament was held in Tunisia where a Zimbabwe team comprising Kieran Vincent, Bekithemba Ndlovu, Amm and Kirsten finished second behind South Africa.Only Amm and Kirsten are still eligible for selection in this year s competition, while the other players in the squad are set for their debut in the team competition.
