The creator of the Gumusluk International Classical Music Festival which is in Turkey, Levendo lu said she was bringing the festival to Zimbabwe to pave way for students to study and perform with international musicians.Since it began in Turkey in 2004, she said the festival had been expanding. I started the G m l k Festival with the aim of giving Turkish music students the chance to study and perform with international musicians. Very quickly there were not just masters coming in to play and mentor, but students from every continent too, she said. And although the academy aspect of the festival was always at the heart of things, the 14 years it has been running has seen G m l k expand astronomically on the concert side, with more and more concerts and a famous piano competition taking place during the festival.
