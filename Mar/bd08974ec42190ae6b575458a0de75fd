THE Africa Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF) has launched a report which will complement government s efforts towards the realisation of the African vision. BY TARISAI MANDIZHAThe report, Africa Capacity Report 2017: Building Capacity in Science, Technology and Innovation for Africa s Transformation, was launched in Harare yesterday.Speaking at the official launch in Harare, Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development permanent secretary Machivenyika Mapuranga said the results of the study, if employed, would provide tangible results which ultimately produce better means of survival for the people. In Africa the implementation of the research findings will go a long way in complementing government s efforts towards the realisation of the African Vision, Mapuranga said.He, however, said the theme of the report was timely when countries were going in an overdrive to achieve the recommendations of the millennium goals as well as the Sustainable Development Goals.Zimbabwe Economic Policy Analysis and Research Unit executive director Gibson Chigumira said, capacity was central for the successful implementation of the strategy and there was more that needs to be done in on science, technology and innovation for Africa s transformation. There is need to invest in human capital research and development of good tertiary education schools, to ensure that we adopt modern technology that enhances competitiveness, Chigumira saidHe said in Zimbabwe there were 100 to 200 scientific articles, while some countries have up to 5 000 showing that the country has not been generating scientific content. He, however, said there were capacity challenges in the educational sector, under performing manufacturing sector, issues of brain drain and refurbishment of infrastructure. Chigumira said a good example in Zimbabwe of Science and Technology Innovation was the Chisumbanje ethanol project, which employs 4 500 people and produces 15 megawatts of electricity. There are competitive challenges coming from shortage of foreign currency, but there is need to increase production. The STI sector needs to be aligned with the overall national goals and transformation from a commodity based economy to STI economy, he said.Speaking at the same event, ACBF director of knowledge and learning Thomas Munthali said ACBF was planning for critical skills programmes and it would vary on case by case basis.
