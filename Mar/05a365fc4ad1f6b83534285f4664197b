BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEPatrick Philip MugadzaThe postponement of the matter followed an application by prosecutor Beaven Murevanhema, who told Justice Priscilla Chigumba that he needed time to file the State s response to the application.Meanwhile, across town at the Harare Magistrates Court, the Prosecutor-General (PG) s Office provided Mugadza with a trial date and the matter is set to be heard on March 30.Mugadza is being represented by Obey Shava, Jeremiah Bamu and Gift Mtisi.Mugadza s trial date came about after Mtisi had applied for refusal of further remand, arguing his client had been remanded on several occasions without any indication for a trial.According to the court papers, on January 12 this year, Mugadza was interviewed by the Zimbabwe Mail, an online publication, and the State alleges he caused to be published a story captioned, Pastor Mugadza says President Mugabe to die in October 2017, which appeared on the same publication on January 13 this year.The State alleges in the interview Mugadza caused an offence and insulted the Christian religion and African tradition by uttering words which are taboo to predict someone s death.
