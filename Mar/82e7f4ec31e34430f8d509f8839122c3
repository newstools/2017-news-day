Premier Soccer League (PSL) side Hwange have reinstated Nation Dube as head coach following the lifting of his suspension by Zifa, which had been slapped over match-fixing allegations. BY FORTUNE MBELEDube was among a group that was accused of planning to fix the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers between Swaziland and Zimbabwe in September last year and the former Warriors assistant coach was also alleged to have been at the centre of throwing away Zimbabwe s matches at the African Nations Championships (Chan) tournament in Rwanda last year.His suspension was lifted after he, together with former Warriors coach Ian Gorowa and ex-Zifa executive committee member Edzai Kasinauyo, were acquitted after trial at the magistrates court.Hwange club chairman Joseph Zulu yesterday confirmed that Dube was back at the helm of the coal miners and would take charge of the team s 2017 PSL campaign. Nation Dube is back with the team as head coach, Zulu said.Mebelo Njekwa, who took over from Dube last year, reverts to his position as assistant coach after guiding Hwange to position 12 with nine wins, nine draws and 12 defeats last season.Dube had led Hwange to position eight in 2015, also with nine wins, but 12 draws and nine defeats, and was suspended by Zifa in March last year, a month after the Warriors returned from the Chan tournament.Kasinauyo and Gorowa also had the suspensions lifted last month with Zifa president Philip Chiyangwa making the announcement, but remained silent on Henrietta Rushwaya, who was alleged to have been the central figure in the plot to fix Warriors matches.Meanwhile, Bulawayo City have sidelined coach Philani Ncube, who was also suspended by Zifa together with club chairman Jerry Sibanda following match-fixing attempts in their match away to Border Strikers in August last year.Ncube and Sibanda also had their suspensions lifted last month, but last week Bulawayo City appointed Mandla Mpofu as head coach with Try Ncube, who took over from Philani last year, reverting to his position as assistant coach.
