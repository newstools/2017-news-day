The National Oil Infrastructure Company of Zimbabwe (NOICZ) has achieved the ISO certification 9001:2008, which is expected to improve the company s service delivery. BY TATIRA ZWINOIRANOIC was set up by government with the mandate of providing bulk transportation, re-delivery service, storage and handling of petroleum products to meet the country s fuel requirements.Speaking at the official presentation of ISO 9001:2008 to NOICZ last week, Energy and Power Development permanent secretary Partson Mbiriri said being ISO certification would contribute to the possible long-term success of the company. The primary focus of quality management is to meet and exceed customer s expectations. Being ISO certified will contribute to the possible long-term success of NOICZ, as it will instil confidence in the company s customers, he said. I am confident that being ISO certified, NOICZ will be in a better position to deliver on the government s strategic mandate of security of fuel supply. NOICZ is responsible for the country s four million litres of fuel consumption that gets into the country on a daily basis.The fuel comes through the Beira to Harare pipeline and largely from the country s top source market for fuel, Saudi Arabia. It is gratifying to know that this quest for service excellence, as demonstrated by the ISO certification, is what continues to propel NOICZ to remain one of the best performing and profitable government-owned companies for a very long time, he said. According to the International Organisation for Standardisation, ISO 9001:2008 specifies requirements for a quality management system, where an organisation needs to show two attributes. A company needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide a product that meets customer, applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.Also, it has to enhance customer satisfaction through the effective application of the system and the assurance of conformity to customer, applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.The government established NOICZ during the restructuring of the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe, as one part of two newly-formed entities.The other entity created is PetroTrade (Private) Limited responsible for fuel trading.
