GOSPEL musician, Joel Chiweda, who cut his teeth in the industry during a fruitful stint with Zimpraise, recently launched a monthly programme called Gospel Soul Nights to create space for music, spoken word and dance by gospel artists. BY TAFADZWA UFUMELIJoel ChiwedaThe programme premiered two weeks ago at Utano Restaurant in Avondale, with upcoming artistes Tammy Moyo, Kim Afro Poetiq Mind Mabika, Ngoni Slickbeatz Chikuse and Trust Makurumure serenading fans with their compelling stage acts. Chiweda told NewsDay last Friday that the programme was inspired by a desire to create space for gospel arts lovers. This initiative is an environment for the gospel lovers and the church community to enjoy music, spoken word, dance and so much more, beyond denominational boundaries and in a Godly space, he said.Chiweda said the programme would also afford artists an opportunity to network with others and create a Christian fan base. He said he had observed that there were more secular art events in the country, which often shut out emerging gospel artists. Gospel Soul Nights are there to perfect what you keep doing and they also create a platform for that artist who has got something to show, Chiweda said. We are definitely looking to grow this gospel event to a bigger outdoor event, where we can hang out on a stretched-out lawn with family and friends, food and drink, with more music and energetic performances from local, regional and even international artists. He said he was hoping that with the passage of time, the show would be aired on ZTV and DStv as the brand grows. We are excited about this event and we are certain it s going to be awesome! This is the beginning, more is coming, he said. This month s edition of the programme will see the return of Tammy Moyo and new acts, including Prayersoul and rising gospel star, Petronellah Sengwayo.
