MUTARE City Council has resolved to terminate contracts of three executives who were last week acquitted of gross incompetence after a disciplinary hearing. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Mutare mayor Tatenda NhamarareThe trio treasurer Lloyd Musasa, human resources manager Aaron Chemvura and acting chamber secretary Gladys Muneta were suspended last year on allegations of abuse of funds.Prominent Mutare lawyer Chris Ndlovu presided over the case and ruled that the local authority had failed to prove its charges against the three beyond reasonable doubt.However, the local authority then engaged constitutional law expert Lovemore Madhuku for advice. Madhuku gave councillors five options and following a special council meeting, the MDC-T-led local authority opted to fire the trio on three months notice. Although the disciplinary authority cleared each of the employees in respect of gross incompetency or inefficiency, it found that the conduct of each employee was less than satisfactory. It, however, excused the employee on the basis that they had not been given performance standards and had not been warned before, the option read. If the City of Mutare is of the view that the employees are no longer suitable for their positions, it may terminate their services by giving each of them three months notice and paying gratuities at the rate of two weeks salary for every year worked. The High Court by Justice Matanda-Moyo has recently found this to be lawful. Mutare mayor Tatenda Nhamarare confirmed the development yesterday, saying that his council was not happy with the three. Despite that they were acquitted, Mutare City Council has decided to terminate their contracts because we were not happy with their conduct before they were suspended, Nhamarare said.The three were accused of not properly managing Mutare Municipality Medical Aid Society funds despite workers making contributions.The scheme was rocked by corruption allegations which saw senior management benefiting from the medical scheme.
