COSMOPOLITAN imbube music outfit, Insingizi, is set perform at the opening ceremony of the Special Olympics World winter games at the Planai Stadium in Schladming, Austria, on March 18. BY SINDISO DUBEInsingiziThe Zimbabwean ensemble secured the sole African ticket to perform at the 2017 edition of the games, running under the theme Heartbeat of the World.The Zimbabweans will be the only Africans performing at the high profile world event. A member of the group, Vusa Mkhaya, said they were excited about the opportunity to represent Africa on the world stage. Our performance slot is 12 minutes long and we will belt out our best, a selection of songs from our three CDs Voices of Southern Africa Vol 1 and 2 and African Harmonies, he said. The opening ceremony will see a jamboree of events including the colourful marching in of all 107 delegations, the hoisting of the Special Olympics flag and the lighting of the Flame of Hope among other special highlights. Insingizi s name derives from the African ground hornbill bird whose call can be heard at a distance of up to 3km.The bird s loud voice and large size have made it a focal point in many traditional African cultures. For some it has become a symbol of the arrival of the rainy season whose anticipation is welcomed as a joyous occasion in villages. The ensemble follows in the vocal tradition of celebrated African vocal groups, Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Black Umfolosi.Insingizi started off as a group of high school singers in 1987. Mkhaya, Dumisani Ramadu Moyo and Blessing Nqo Nkomo are the surviving members from the original troupe. Their last album, African Harmonies, includes songs of celebration and also warnings to political leaders to make sure they keep on the path to positive change.
