THREE suspected armed robbers yesterday appeared at the High Court charged with killing a gold buyer whom they robbed of $300 cash, a scale and 5, 5 grams of gold. BY CHARLES LAITONThe cold-blooded murder is alleged to have occurred on March 5, 2016 at Mutiti Farm along Mukaradzi River in Mt Darwin.It is the State s case that the three suspects brothers, Andrew and Gregory Guduza, along with Zvioneso Chaira connived to target and attack gold buyers before approaching one victim identified in court papers as Kusema. The State alleges that the plan to rob gold buyers was mooted on February 28 last year when the trio secured two firearms, a Luger Grand Power pistol with 10 rounds and a 38 Special Taurus revolver with 10 rounds.It is alleged that the three met Kusema, who was in the company of his girlfriend Ketai Nyauyanga, along Mukaradzi River, while armed with the guns.Following a purported discussion on a possible gold deal, an argument reportedly ensued before the suspects produced guns.The State alleges Gregory pointed the revolver at Kusema and threatened him with arrest, but Andrew subsequently produced his gun and fired a single shot which hit the now deceased once on the face, killing him on the spot.After the killing, the three men allegedly searched the deceased s body and stole a scale, 5,5 grams of gold and $300 cash from his pocket before disappearing from the scene.In her statement to the police, Nyauyanga said when she realised the two men had produced firearms, she fled the scene, but shortly afterwards heard a gunshot from a distance after which she learnt her boyfriend had been killed.The matter was reported to the police and investigations led to the trio s arrest. They are denying the charge after appearing before Justice Amie Tsanga.Chaira and Andrew are being represented by Advocate Edley Mubaira and Brian Hungwe from Harare Law Chambers, while Gregory is being represented by Simba Mubvuma.Albert Masamha is appearing for the State.
