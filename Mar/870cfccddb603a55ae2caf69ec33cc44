THE national army will be reinforcing security at Luveve Stadium tomorrow for the Zimbabwe National Army Charities Shield semi-final between Highlanders and FC Platinum after the game was moved from bigger Barbourfields (BF) Stadium. BY FORTUNE MBELEThe Barbourfields Stadium pitch has been unplayable following the heavy rains that have continued to hit Bulawayo. Lieutenant-Colonel Fabion Chitungo of the army public relations yesterday said they would have preferred BF, but the match will go ahead at Luveve and they are hopeful the weather will not let them down. The game is on Sunday (tomorrow) at Luveve and I hope the weather favours us. Security might be a challenge which is a cause for concern. We are working on those logistics. Barbourfields would have been better but we are reinforcing our security personnel that will be at Luveve, Lieutenant-Colonel Chitungo said.He said 10 000 spectators paid to watch the other semi-final tie between Caps United and Dynamos at the National Sports Stadium on February 26 and the army is expecting to raise $20 000 from the match at Luveve to be channelled towards the army charities.Highlanders, who lost 2-1 to Zambia s Power Dynamos on Tuesday at Luveve will be hoping to progress to final to defend the ZNA Charity Shield against Caps United on March 26.Last year Highlanders beat Harare City at Barbourfields to defend the cup which they also won in 2015 after beating Dynamos.The Bosso fans have a chance to get a glimpse into what the season holds for them as Bosso parades its biggest signing Roderick Mutuma.Coach Erol Akbay is aiming at inspiring his side into the finals. We are ready to defend the cup but we have been disadvantaged in our preparations because of the rains and we have not had good practice for a full pitch as we have been using the small artificial turf pitch as other grounds are water-logged, Akbay said.FC Platinum will also be hoping to ride over Highlanders, whom they beat twice and played a draw last year.Coach Norman Mapeza has added Gift Mbweti, Brett Amidu and Talent Chawapiwa to his squad.FC Platinum beat Premier Soccer League returnees Shabanie Mine 4-1 in a penalty shoot-out last week in the CG Msipa Charity Cup at Maglas Stadium.
