SUNGURA musician Tedious Matsito, who recently suffered a stroke, has vowed to release his 23rd album once he recovers. BY JAIROS SAUNYAMASince 2013, the Ngwenya Brothers frontman has been struggling to record the six-track album Mandipa Mukana due to lack of funds.The 47-year-old musician, who is still struggling to speak as a result of the stroke, said music remains a part of his life. I will be in the studio as soon as I recover. The songs are there. I suffered a stroke recently, but I am recuperating at home. I will release the album, he said. The Manyemwe Emhuru hitmaker, whose misfortunes began following a car accident in 2009, causing the amputation of his left leg, wanted to release the album in July last year, but failed to secure money to book a recording slot.The album is an acknowledgment that God has given him another chance to live, Matsito said. The title was, however, coined after the 2009 accident before he suffered a stroke while on duty in South Africa.A former gardener, Matsito rose to fame following the release of Gede. His leg developed gangrene in May 2012 from injuries sustained in the 2008 car accident which claimed some of his band members and destroyed all his instruments. Matsito has been receiving assistance from local promoters, who have been holding charity gigs with the proceeds being channelled to him.
