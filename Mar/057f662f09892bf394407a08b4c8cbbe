THE opening of the tobacco selling season creates a fresh wave of expenditure patterns with entrepreneurs and companies jostling to get a share of the windfall from the gold leaf. BY BUSINESS REPORTER State-owned NetOne, which was the only mobile network operator to record growth in active subscribers last year, has invaded the auction floors to market its products and has so far endeared itself with farmers.A farmer from Mashonaland Central, Tonderai Shinje, said the proliferation of social media use meant mobile network operators needed to create tailor-made products that could benefit rural people and farmers in particular who do not necessarily use their phone every day given the power challenges they face on a daily basis. He added that NetOne s OneFusion product might be the answer to farmers communication challenges. I was surprised to purchase the recharge cards and $5 will last me 30 days. I have been using at least $5 a day going on the Internet and for WhatsApp bundles. It was not easy on the pocket. I am happy to be on this package and as soon as I return to the farm, I will register my farm manager and all the farm workers since its saves on costs plus calling across the same network is almost for free, Shinje said.A farmer from Karoi, Marshal Chirenga, also expressed satisfaction with the mobile operator s new package and the latitude it provides for his communication needs.NetOne marketing executive Fungai Ndoro said Zimbabweans deserved a package that listens to their pocket while providing unparalleled connection .NetOne launched the OneFusion package last July, but only began an aggressive marketing campaign early this year in what has become a cut-throat sector that remains among the few growing industries in the country.
