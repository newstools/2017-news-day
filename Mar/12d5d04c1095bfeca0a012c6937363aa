A ZIMBABWEAN company based in South Africa, Ruffkurt Africa, has contracted two local upcoming artistes and two South Africans in efforts to enhance its brand and promote artistes, after focusing on fashion since 2012. BY OWN CORRESPONDENT Takudzwa Bouy Tace Janga Local hip-hop artistes Takudzwa Bouy Tace Janga and Richie Willis, as well as South African rapper Paula Israella-Dior Bukson and Khumbulani Rhumshi Kuwane appended their signatures to the deal. Ruffkurt Africa was the first company to host Freeman, Stunner, Seh Calaz and Lady Squanda in Cape Town.Head of the company s entertainment department Progress Chisara, confirmed the latest development, saying the pact with the artistes will go a long way in promoting both the brand and local artistes. We don t want to use them (artistes) to market our label, but to share their unrecognised talent with the world, Chisara said. We want them to produce good music, be role models and in overall lift the country s flag higher above the rest and get recognition in Africa. He said they will soon engage Zambian and Nigerian artistes.Bouy Tace confirmed his contract with Ruffkurt, saying the development will take his music career a long way. I have signed contract with Ruffkurt. I can say it is the new family in the music arena. I am expecting 100% quality production because my stuff will be well-handled. A lot is going to change this year, I promise, he said. The ambitious artiste hinted that as Ruffkurt they will soon release a track titled Our New Africa and a remix for his 2016 song Ain t Going Back. He has so far recorded two albums, On My Way and Young, Gifted Boy and 15 singles, while Richie Willies has one album, Untrustworthy under his name and five singles. Rumshi is well known in Capetown and Burkson is yet to be recognised by many music lovers.
