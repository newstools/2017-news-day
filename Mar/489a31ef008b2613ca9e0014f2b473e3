The SSB [Salary Services Bureau] raised a surcharge of $1 064,61 in respect of salary and allowances overpaid for the period stated August 23 2013 to August 31 2013 . . . and to the late notification of termination of your services as minister, part of the letter read.But Mangoma yesterday questioned why it had taken the SSB so long to realise that they had overpaid him. The SSB should actually be paying me monies owed to me by government for my services as Energy minister. I am equally shocked that they want money from me and it is not the other way round, he said.Dihwa could not be reached for comment, as he was said to be in a meeting.Mangoma was among top MDC-T officials appointed Cabinet ministers in the inclusive government, which also included Zanu PF and MDC.
