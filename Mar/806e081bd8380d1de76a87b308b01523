BY KENNETH NYANGANI Passing judgment on Wednesday, the judge said the quartet of John, Joe, Mathious and Blessing Chigayi from Nhamo village under chief Nyashanu in Buhera, deserved long imprisonment for the gruesome killing of their father, Sam Chigayi.According to prosecutor Malvern Musarurwa, on December 11, 2015 the accused persons took their father to a traditional healer who indicated that he was a wizard causing all sorts of problems in the family.Upon returning home, the accused persons grabbed their father and took him into his bedroom where they started assaulting him. They lit plastic containers of opaque beer and dropped the burning plastic on him.The brothers force-marched their father outside before tying his hands and neck onto a tree where they again severely burnt him on the back before assaulting him again.His daughters, Janet and Grace, arrived at the scene, but the accused warned them not to rescue him or take him to hospital for treatment.The late Chigayi spent the day at home and succumbed to the assault the following morning.According to a postmortem carried out at Rusape General hospital, Chigayi died from injuries sustained during the torture.
