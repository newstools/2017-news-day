THE People s Democratic Party (PDP) is irked by the threats to introduce command economics by Zanu PF. We view the move as ill-informed, ignorant and bound to fail. PDP Spokesperson Jacob MafumeVice President Emmerson MnangagwaVice-President Emmerson Mnangangwa recently told a gathering that the government is now working on a plan to introduce command strategy on everything, including education and health.He used an unproven argument that command works because of the projected bumper harvest, deliberately misinforming the nation that the harvest is a result of the command scheme.Farmers who are not directly linked to Zanu PF did not access the inputs. The percentage of the beneficiaries is, therefore, too insignificant to attribute a successful agriculture season to the programme.As we have mentioned before, the loan used to fund the purchase of inputs in the scheme has inflated interest rates.More importantly, Zanu PF has always failed to put in place a mechanism to recover loans extended to its cronies.With that in mind, it is inevitable for Zanu PF to force the people of Zimbabwe to repay the debt the same way they did with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe debt.Using such a model in the broader economy will only serve to create more debts for the people of Zimbabwe, while Zanu PF-linked individuals continue to enjoy the fruits of the dirty loans.Instead, Zanu PF must fix the basics. Zimbabwe needs to do the following:With a functional economy, education and health, it will then need government intervention in creating a welfare state with social safety nets uplifting the disadvantaged due to the lottery of nature assisting them to even up and be able to live personal determined lives.As a matter of fact, Mnangagwa must attempt to command the reduction of roadblocks, an end to corruption and the insatiable appetite to fly in and out by the Executive.
