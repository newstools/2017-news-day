PREMIER Soccer League (PSL) side FC Platinum are reluctant to have their coach Norman Mapeza double as the Warriors head of technical team on a permanent basis. BY MUKUDZEI CHINGWERE Norman MapezaThe Zvishavane-based side have released Mapeza to take charge of the national team in their friendly match against Zambia on Sunday, but are not keen on the idea of the arrangement for future matches.Mapeza has been touted as the preferred candidate to take over the reins on a permanent basis, but his job at FC Platinum who are chasing an elusive PSL title might hinder his dream of bossing the Warriors in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers which start in June.Yesterday FC Platinum media liaison officer Chido Chizondo said the club had agreed to release Mapeza for this week&#8217;s match against Zambia, but would have to consider their own situation should the coach be asked to take the job on a permanent basis. We have received communication from Zifa and the coach will join the national team. We appreciate the importance of this assignment, Chizondo said. We, however, await further communication on the duration of his service with the national team. With regard to the future, we would have to sit down and assess how it would impact the club if he is asked to take up the job. An insider, however, said they were not too keen on having their coach engaging in the Warriors job, which demands a lot of time and commitment.They feel that divided attention could hinder their bid to conquer the domestic league this season having set themselves big targets this time around. The Warriors job itself is quite demanding and it is unlikely that a coach may be able to carry both the national team and an ambitious club like ours without compromising the other, said the source. We will have to see because at the moment he (Mapeza) has been asked to take charge of just one match. It is likely that if Zifa were to offer Mapeza the job, he would have to choose between the Warriors and FC Platinum as may not be able to shoulder both responsibilities.On Tuesday Zifa announced that Mapeza would be in charge of the national team on an interim basis as the mother body seeks to appoint a permanent coach.NewsDaySport revealed last month that Mapeza topped Zifa s wish list and the coach also said that he was willing to engage the mother body if approached.The temporary appointment has given the strongest hint yet that Zifa are preparing to give Mapeza the job on a permanent basis.But yesterday FC Platinum poured cold water on any possible deal between the two parties after telling NewsDaySport that the coach would not be allowed to work for the national team while still at FC Platinum.It also emerged that the national association had not sought FC Platinum&#8217;s blessings before making the announcement.Mapeza has been given the perfect ambience to mount a serious challenge for the league&#8217;s ultimate prize with the platinum miners and the club unlikely to accept failure as an option this time.His failure to win the title last season after making a promising start in the race is sure to have left a sour taste within the club executive. Mapeza s first appointment as Warriors mentor ended in acrimony with him taking the legal route against the association to settle his outstanding allowances.He is one of a number of coaches who include, among others, Rahman Gumbo, Kalisto Pasuwa, Madinda Ndlovu, Charles Mhlauri and Sunday Chidzambwa, who are still owed by the association after stints with the Warriors.The debt has not affected Mapeza s interest in the Warriors job. He is unlikely, however, to relinquish his stable job at FC Platinum, where he is well-remunerated, for the Warriors job, where there is uncertainty over payment and also lack of job security.Meanwhile, Mapeza has picked Ngezi Platinum coach Tonderai Ndiraya as well as Mandla Mpofu as his assistants for the Zambia friendly on Sunday.He also announced a 23-member squad to prepare for the match.Goalkeepers: Edmore Sibanda (Caps United), Petros Mhari (FC Platinum), Ariel Sibanda (Highlanders) Defenders: Partson Jaure, Godknows Murwira, Qadar Amin (all Ngezi Platinum Stars), Peter Muduwa (Highlanders), Teenage Hadebe (Chicken Inn), Dennis Dauda (Caps United), Ocean Mushure (Dynamos) Midfielders: Winston Mhango, Rodwell Chinyengetere (both FC Platinum), Ronald Chitiyo, Devon Chafa (both Caps United), Liberty Chakoroma (Ngezi Platinum), Raphael Manuvire (ZPC Kariba), Sipho Ndlovu (Bulawayo City). Strikers: Donald Teguru, Terrence Dzukamanja (both Ngezi Platinum), Evans Rusike (Maritzburg United), Tendai Ndoro (Orlando Pirates), Prince Dube (Highlanders) and Masimba Mambare (Dynamos)</strong>
