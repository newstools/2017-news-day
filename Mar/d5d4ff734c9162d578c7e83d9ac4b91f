HERITAGE Press founder Wellington Kusema s poetry anthology, Lazaruses and Devases, has been adapted to reggae music as a way of helping students internalise the poems, following its selection as an Ordinary Level English Literature set book. BY PRECIOUS CHIDA Kusema told NewsDay yesterday that the music genre into which the book has been converted is called duff hebron poetry, which is based on roots reggae music. I feel very happy that we were fortunate to have won a National Arts Merit Awards in 2012 and now the book has also been approved to become a set book, which is a great achievement on my part, he said.Written in 2011, the collection of poems was published by Heritage Press in 2012, the same year in which it scooped the gong.The book will be among the set texts whose school cycle will run from 2017 to 2021.
