CAPS United coach Lloyd Chitembwe anticipates a tough match when his side begin their Castle Lager Premier Soccer League title defence with a match against returnees Shabanie Mine at Maglas Stadium this weekend. BY FORTUNE MBELEAfter beating Highlanders to lift the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) Charities Shield at Barbourfields Stadium on Saturday, Chitembwe, praised his boys for putting up a gallant show against the Bulawayo giants although he missed six key players, four of whom were on national duty.Goalkeeper Edmore Sibanda, midfielders Ronald Chitiyo and Devon Chafa as well as defender Dennis Dauda were part of the squad that played Zambia in an international friendly at the National Sports Stadium yesterday. I have talented boys and despite missing six key players, those who were here put up good show and every opportunity to play is very important for us and this was very valuable to keep the momentum. It will be very difficult against Shabanie Mine. They are not very easy to play at Maglas and we anticipate a very difficult game, Chitembwe said.Caps will be hoping for a good start when they open the 2017 season account in Zvishavane, but Chitembwe is not oblivious to the fact that a win there will be tough.The Green Machine s confidence is high after taking the first piece of silverware on offer after winning the ZNA Charities Shield albeit via a penalty shootout after a goalless draw.Skipper Moses Muchenje ruled the roost in midfield where Highlanders had the young Brian Banda, Simon Munawa, Allen Gahadzikwa and captain Tendai Ngulube as defensive link-man.Highlanders walked away with $8 000 after surrendering the Charity Shield to the league champions.Tafadzwa Rusike and Cabby Kamhapa penetrated the Highlanders defence at will, but they were let down by veteran striker Leonard Tsipa, who did not have a good game on Saturday, with defender Carlton Munzabwa also guilty of silly mistakes at the rear where he was troubled by the speedy Gabriel Nyoni.After the Shabanie Mine match, Caps United host Harare City in the capital.
