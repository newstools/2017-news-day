THE Messenger of Court yesterday swooped on the Zimbabwe Youth Council (ZYC) headquarters in Harare and attached furniture, computers and various other equipment to recover over $6 000 in rent arrears accrued by its Bulawayo office. BY OBEY MANAYITIWhen NewsDay arrived at the ZYC offices in Harare, Messenger of Court personnel were still loading various items as employees pleaded in vain to keep their database.According to court documents, ZYC was renting offices from one Francis Chirara for $350 a month, but had been defaulting payment, prompting the owner to take legal action. In breach of the lease agreement, you vacated the premises on February 3, 2015 without informing our client or giving the requisite notice in terms of the lease agreement. We are further instructed that at the time you vacated the premise, you had failed, refused or neglected to pay rentals, rates and electricity charges since October 2013, a letter of final demand to ZYC read. At the time you vacated the premises, your arrear rentals were in the sum of $4 200, local authority rates arrears were $966,55 while electricity charges were $1 100, giving a total of $6 266,55, which amount remains outstanding to date. In a statement, acting ZYC director Tanzika Guranungo said they had been requesting for funds for their provincial offices since 2013 from Treasury without success. He said ZYC was liaising with the Youth ministry to settle the arrears.
