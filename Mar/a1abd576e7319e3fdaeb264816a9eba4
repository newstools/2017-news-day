VETERAN Caps United striker Leonard Tsipa (pictured) is set to return to the Green Machine squad for the Confederation of African Football (Caf) Champions League group stage, as the window for the registration of new players reopens ahead of the next stage. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKALeonard TsipaThe 35-year-old, who was instrumental as Caps United won the championship for the first time last season since 2005, was deregistered by the club over uncertainity about his availability to the team this season.Tsipa, who had been club hunting in Tanzania and Ethiopia, subsequently missed matches against Lesotho champions Lioli and TP Mazembe.The Zimbabwean champions battled to a 0-0 draw against TP Mazembe five-time winners of the African Champions League to go through to the group stage on the away goals rule after having forced a 1-1 draw away in Lubumbashi in the reverse fixture. It is the first time in their history to achieve that feat.And as the Green Machine ready for the group stage of the prestigious tournament, Tsipa is set to fill one of the five slots.Club chief executive Cuthbert Chitima said yesterday they had started the process of registering Tsipa. We have five slots and Tsipa will fill one of the slots. We have begun the process of registering him ahead of the group stage. As for the other remaining slots we will have to hear from the coach whether there are going to be additions, Chitima said.Caps United are most likely to face a tough draw after they were placed in Pot 4 when the 16 qualified teams were yesterday divided into four groups, graded according to their points on Caf s five-year ranking.The five-year ranking is used by Caf to determine the number of clubs that each Caf member association may enter in Africa s club football competitions, the Caf Champions League and the Caf Confederations Cup.At present, those associations ranked in the top 12 may enter two sides into each of the two continental tournaments, while the remaining associations are limited to a single side in each competition.Zimbabwe are ranked at number 18, with local clubs finding it difficult in continental football, resulting in Caps United, with zero points, placed in the lowest-ranked Pot 4 in the seeding.Other qualified teams with zero points and in Pot 4 together with Caps United are Zanaco of Zambia, Ferrovi rio Beira of Mozambique and Saint George of Ethiopia.Each side will draw one team from each pot.The Harare giants cannot face any one of the teams in Pot 4, but are on a collision course with some of the continent s football heavyweights who have been placed in top pots.They are sure to meet one of Zamalek, Al-Ahly (Egypt), toile du Sahel (Tunisia) or the tournament s defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa, all placed in Pot 1.Pot 2 is dominated by North African teams in Esp rance de Tunis (Tunisia), Wydad Casablanca (Morocco), USM Alger (Algeria) and Sudanese giants Al-Hilal, of which Caps United will also get one from this pot.Caps third opponents in the group stages will come from Pot 3, which contains Al-Merrikh (Sudan), Coton Sport (Cameroon), AS Vita (DRC) and Al-Ahli Tripoli (Libya)The first set of matches will be played on May 12, 2017.
