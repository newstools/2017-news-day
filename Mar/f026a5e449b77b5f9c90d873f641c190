BY STEPHEN CHADENGAIn a notice by the registrar, MSU also announced that students who do not produce evidence of class attendance and continuous assessment will not write exams.MSU said initial and late registration ends on March 31 and April 28 respectively with students on a payment plan expected to produce printed and stamped online payment plans in class. All students, new and returning are advised that in order to attend lectures, students must have either paid fees and registered or be on an approved payment plan, part of the notice reads. Please note that no student shall be allowed to sit for the May June 2017 examinations without complying with the above. Make haste to regularise your status as it will be virtually impossible for you to write examinations before fulfilling the following; evidence of class attendance and evidence of continuous assessment.&#8221;The decision is set to disenfranchise many students whose parents are finding it difficult to pay for their children s university education as the economy continues to plummet.
