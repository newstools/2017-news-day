WATORA Mari hit-maker, Jah Prayzah is ostensibly in a bid to conquer Africa, if his recent engagement of West African music stakeholders is anything to go by. BY KENNEDY NYAVAYAJah PrayzahThe musician took to social media site Instagram to post a picture of him posing with Anderson Abiagwa and Stanely Enow from Nigeria and Cameroon respectively along with a caption insinuating he has struck a deal with them. Im here with @bigaent @stanleyenow in Dallas ofcoz we up to something . . . read the caption.Obiagwu is the founder of Big A Entertainment, a company aimed at promoting African Music to the rest of the world by assisting African Artistes cross over boundaries within the music industry and discover new niches, according to their website.He is also the man behind the much-venerated African Muzik Magazine Awards (AFRIMMA), which has uplifted some music heavyweights in the continent.E now on the other hand is well-known for winning the Best New Act MTV Africa in 2014, as well as AFRIMMA Best Male Central Africa in 2015 and another AFRIMMA in the Best Hip Hop in 2016.Jah Prayzah s manager, Keen Mushapaidze confirmed that the trio met in the United States, but said details of their meeting are still sketchy. We can confirm that they met and discussed business but at this moment we do not have a firm word of what has been agreed on, Mushapaidze said.Ranked as one of the most successful artistes of his generation it appears Jah Prayzah, a perennial award-winning music virtuoso, will not stop trying to penetrate new markets until the continent recognises his talent.The musician has had rich pickings off his collaboration with Tanzanian superstar, Diamond Platnumz last year, which resulted in him winning an Mtv Africa Music Awards (MAMA) gong and landing his video on acclaimed regional television channels.This year, he is has since worked with South African duo of Mafikizolo on two songs which are yet to be released.
