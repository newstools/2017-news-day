Ronald is okay now. He is fully fit and will be part of the travelling squad, Chiripamberi said.This comes as good news to the Caps United faithful ahead of the important clash as the Green Machine target a place in the group stages of the competition.Coach Lloyd Chitembwe and his men will be looking for a result which keeps them in the tie by the time they host TP Mazembe on March 19.The DRC champions, who are also the Confederations Cup title holders, have proved a difficult team to beat in their own backyard.However, last season, TP Mazembe failed to make it to the group stages of the Caf Champions League after they were booted out by Moroccan side Wydad Casablanca. Caps United can draw inspiration from that, as the Moroccan outfit managed to force a 1-1 draw at the Stade TP Mazembe, where they draw crowds averaging 18 000.Mazembe dropped to the Caf Confederations Cup, where in the group stages they won all their home matches against Mo Bejaia, Medeama and Tanzania s Young Africans.Tunisia s Etoile du Sahel also managed to force a draw at the Stade TP Mazembe, but the DRC side went through and went all the way to win the tournament.Caps United have targeted qualification to the group stage, which comes with huge financial rewards.TP Mazembe have enjoyed success against Zimbabwean opposition, having upstaged Dynamos 2-1 in the Lubumbashi clash, while a year earlier, Monomotapa lost 2-0 at home, before the 5-0 thrashing away from home in the group stages.
