RISING gospel musician Knowledge Khanye believes his second offering, Kutaura Nemi, is a breakthrough effort, which will spur his career to dizzy heights after it got him nominated for an award at the upcoming Masvingo Music Awards. BY KENNEDY NYAVAYAKnowledge KhanyeKhanye will battle it out with five other musicians in the Best Gospel Artiste category at the awards fourth edition scheduled for Saturday.Khanye, whose debut album got him nominated two times in different categories at last year s Midlands awards, has high hopes of getting the gong this time around. I am quite excited. It shows that my work is being recognised and I need to work much harder to appear in coming years as well, he said. It is a stiff competition, but who knows what will happen? I was nominated meaning I have the potential to snatch it. The Zvishavane-bred musician said his new eight-track album, which was produced by Blessing Masanga, is laden with prayer through lyrics. The title itself is self-defining, as I am talking of communication between man and God, Khanye, who is also popularly known as Knowle-mwana said.In the new offering, the multilingual artiste explores his unique ability to communicate in different local languages. Five of the songs are in Shona, two in Ndebele and one in English. He says he will be adding a Sesotho track on the next album.Although the album was recorded last year, he had to shelf it owing to lack of funds to pay for its release. The challenge I face is that I do not have any instruments at all and buying them is a challenge because of lack of funds. I also do not have ample time to do live shows because I work somewhere and travelling hindrances are a barrier, he said.
