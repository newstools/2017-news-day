DYNAMOS star centre-back Elisha Muroiwa will be earning a mega salary of around $6 000 per month at his new Tanzanian top-flight league side Singinda United, it has emerged. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKAElisha Muroiwa (right) pens his new contract for Tanzanian club Singida United, along with a club official, after getting his signing-on fees of $20 000 in cash [on the table]The stocky defender, together with teammate Wisdom Mutasa, both signed two-year deals with the newly-promoted side, which they will join in June.While Mutasa will also be earning close to that figure, Muroiwa s profile as a key member of the Warriors appears to have played a huge part in his salary negotiations.He was part of the Warriors squad that participated at the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations finals in Gabon in January. He also featured regularly for the Kalisto Pasuwa-coached side during the qualifiers.According to sources close to the deal, Muroiwa pocketed a signing-on fee of $20 000. In Tanzania players are paid their signing-on fees at once upon signing.The Tanzanian Premiership newboys have already snapped up Chicken Inn and Warriors midfielder Tafadzwa Kutinyu.Reports from Tanzania suggested that the ambitious club has identified Donald Ngoma and Thabani Kamusoko, highly-rated in that country, as their number one targets.Ngoma and Kamusoko currently play for Tanzanian champions Young Africans, but have not renewed their contracts which expire at the end of the year. Muroiwa and Mutasa are the latest local stars to have clinched lucrative contracts in Tanzania, following the departure of Bruce Kangwa and Method Mwanjali last year. The salaries and signing-on fees in the East African country compare favourably with those in the South African Premier Soccer League and are a far cry from what local Premiership sides offer.Even the highest-paying local teams, FC Platinum, Caps United and Harare City, pay about half of what Tanzanian clubs pay in signing-on fees. Crucially, the Tanzanian clubs pay the money at once, while in Zimbabwe payments are staggered and players rarely get the full amount.The best-paying local clubs, such as Harare City, Caps United and FC Platinum, pay an average salary of $1 000 with most clubs, including Dynamos, way below those figures.Muroiwa and Mutasa are set to link up with their new teammates mid-June ahead of the pre-season preparations.Dynamos have been rebuilding a new team around experienced players like Muroiwa following the departure of several key players.However, that rebuilding exercise has suffered a blow with the imminent departures of these players.The good news is that they have Muroiwa and Mutasa until June.The Glamour Boys, who had a disappointing campaign last term in which they finished in fifth place, have a tough opening fixture against FC Platinum at home on Sunday.After that, they make the trip to Triangle for another tricky encounter. They host Premiership returnees Black Rhinos in week three before embarking on another long trip to the Colliery to face Hwange.Then there is the Harare derby set for week seven when they host Caps United and soon after, they travel to Bulawayo for another high-profile clash with Highlanders.
