MBIRA songbird Hope Masike is touring learning institutions, imparting knowledge about the creative industry and distributing sanitary pads to girls as a United States embassy alumnus. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKOHope MasikeNewsDay caught up with Masike at Great Zimbabwe University over the weekend, after her Friday visit to Danhiko Secondary School.Speaking before meeting students from the Music and Performing Arts departments she revealed that the visits were mainly focusing on enlightening young people about the creative industries. I was invited here as part of the Alumni for the US Embassy to talk with students in the performing arts department about opportunities in the creative industries, their benefit to the nation and my experience so far, she said.Masike said reaching out would pave the way for numerous opportunities in the industry that are not known by many people. Many people think that the only thing one can do in this industry is being an artiste, not knowing that there are a lot or different jobs that create the industry. It is great to reach out to these youngsters, who are still learning so, that when they leave schools they can create employment themselves, she said.She said plans were underway to visit her former schools Mbizi Primary School in Highfield, Mabelreign Girls High School and Harare Polytechnic College and other institutions in partnership with Farai pads manufacturers who are distributing pads.Masike s manager, Lucky Muzova, said their main target was the needy. The whole idea is to assist the underprivileged, those who still think talking about pads is a taboo, he said.A GZU lecturer said a number of female students were set to benefit from the interaction. Interacting with someone who is nationally and internationally recognised will boost their confidence. As they chat with her, see how she performs there to adjust to avoid much stumbling in their carrier, she said.
