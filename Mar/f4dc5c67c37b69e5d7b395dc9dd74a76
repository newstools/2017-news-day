BY MUKUDZEI CHINGWEREDynamos head coach Lloyd MutasaLivingston Genti s late own goal was enough to give DeMbare a moral boosting victory.It was a game in which the defence comprised of Warriors centre back Elisha Muroiwa, former Kaizer Chiefs defender Lincoln Zvasiya, Captain Ocean Mushure and promising wingback Peace Makaha performed admirably.It was, however, the coming in of former Monomotapa and Triangle head coach Zuze that Mutasa feels will add value to the former champions quest to retain coronation. Like any other institutions, you would like to be surrounded by the best brains and I am no exception. It is good home coming for Biggie and we welcomed him home. The team is progressing well and I think by the time the season starts we will be ready to compete. Our problem was conceding goals and today I am happy we have managed to keep a clean sheet, Mutasa said.Meanwhile, Chapungu coach Tendai Chikuni was also happy with his side s performance, saying they showed that they are capable to stand against the league s best. Today I was not worried with the result but to assess our strengths going into the new season. The players are adapting well to the philosophy of retaining possession I want them to play. Their performance was encouraging and we have the capacity to stand against the best, Chikuni said.
