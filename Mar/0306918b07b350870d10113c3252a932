The investigation officer (IO) in the matter involving 65 Epworth protesters who were removed from remand on Tuesday this week, yesterday received the full wrath of the law after he was slapped with a 20-day jail term for defaulting trial which led to the release of the suspects. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEThe officer, Tendai Chimboza, was, however, lucky to escape effective imprisonment after magistrate Victoria Mashamba suspended the jail term and ordered him to pay a $20 fine.Chimboza, who is the State s key witness in the matter, reportedly failed to arrive at the court on time, prompting defence lawyers from the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, Obey Shava, Trust Maanda and Gift Mtisi, to apply for remand refusal, which application was granted by the court.The application for refusal of further remand came after several postponements of the matter and on some occasion on petty issues resulting in the magistrate losing patience.At one point, the trial was postponed at the instance of the State, which said its witness, Chimboza, had a similar surname with the presiding magistrate, Barbara Chimboza.In her determination, Mashamba ruled that the protesters be removed from remand and that they would be summoned to court once investigations were complete.Only 23 of the 65 protesters were furnished with State papers, which was an indication that the State was not ready for the trial. The protesters were arrested in Epworth on July 4 last year while demonstrating over police corruption at roadblocks.
