Zanu PF factional fights have affected stability within the war veterans, Parliament heard yesterday. BY XOLISANI NCUBETshinga DubeResponding to a question from Manicaland Senator David Chimhini (MDC-T), War Veterans minister Tshinga Dube said the ongoing Zanu PF fights were destablising the ex-freedom fighters and this was now posing a security threat. If we did not have the situation in the party, we would not have the discord you are asking about. You can t separate the two, he said.Chimhini had asked the minister if the disharmony within the war veterans camp was not a security threat, as two factions have emerged claiming leadership of the group after Zanu PF broke ranks with the Christopher Mutsvangwa-led Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA) executive.Pressed for clarification by the Senator, Dube insisted that war veterans and Zanu PF were one and the instability in the party was affecting the stability within the rank and file of the former freedom fighters .The ZNLWVA is demanding President Robert Mugabe to step down to make way for Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa.The ZNLWVA has accused the Zanu PF G40 faction of abusing Mugabe and hijacking the ruling party and the government for selfish gains.But the G40 faction, which has party commissar Saviour Kasukuwere and Higher Education minister Jonathan Moyo in its ranks, on the other hand, accuses the Team Lacoste faction, which is reportedly sympathetic to Mnangagwa, of trying to topple Mugabe from power.
