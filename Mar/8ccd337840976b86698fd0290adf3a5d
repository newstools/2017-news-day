HIP-hop prodigy Tinotenda Martin Chikunichawa known in the showbiz circles as TIC has combined voices with jazz musician, Tinomutenda Chidziva for the fight against child abuse with the release of a duet titled Sorojena. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOTICThe ambitious Dzivaresekwa-bred musician told NewsDay that while there are many initiatives by several organisations and stakeholders fighting child abuse, he felt that as a musician he must also be involved in the fight against the social ill. As musicians we have the ability to advocate for change and foster a positive influence to society through our compositions, hence the decision to come up with this song. Many girls across the country are exposed to violence, sexual harassment and are forced into early marriages and this song is calling for the end of such behaviour on the girl child, he said. Some of the children who are our future leaders are being abused in different ways across the country and the message on this song is a call for a child abuse-free society. TIC said they were now mobilising resources for the video, as they want the message to reach a wider audience for a positive cause.He said he was eyeing more collaborative projects with some seasoned musicians across genres for future projects.TIC is famed for hit songs such as End of We, All Mi Life, This is My Home and I Love You Girl which received rotational airplay on local radio stations.
