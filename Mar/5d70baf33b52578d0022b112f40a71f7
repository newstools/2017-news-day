THE new Companies Bill is going for peer review and will be submitted for consideration by a Cabinet committee on legislation before month-end, a government official has said. BY TARISAI MANDIZHAA number of legislations were also set to be amended and the government has set up specialised committees to craft far-reaching reforms, in as far as business reforms were concerned.Speaking at the Ease of Doing Export Business Rapid Results Initiative Final Review meeting last week, deputy chief secretary to the President and Cabinet, Ray Ndhlukula said government has been implementing the Ease of Doing Business Reforms since September 2015, as part of its broad economic reform agenda. He said the reform initiative would be further buttressed by developments happening on the legislative front. The Companies Act, together with other related laws and procedures, are being amended and streamlined to conform to the needs of the Zimbabwean business climate and contemporary best practices. The Bill is going for peer review and will be submitted for consideration by Cabinet Committee on Legislation before mid-March 2017. It is our expectation that it will be enacted into law in the first half of 2017, Ndhlukula said.He, however, said this reform initiative was a response by government to several barriers which were identified by industry as major obstacles to export sector growth, such as complex and burdensome procedures administered by multiple regulatory agencies, high costs of production, limited access to affordable long-term trade finance and centralisation of agencies in major cities, among others.Under the current Companies Act, over 600 000 companies were registered and in some cases with no proof of residence of the directors. Due to such flaws in the current regulation, it was noted that too many fraudulent activities had occurred that otherwise could have been prevented by robust legislation. The Companies Act came into effect in 1952 and lags behind constitutional, technological, economical, and other developments that have taken place in Zimbabwe over the years, according to a review posted on the Ministry of Justice website. Consequently, the legislative framework lacks such progressive mechanisms as corporate governance, the website said, adding that the present law limited the extent to which companies could embrace co-ordinated and comprehensible approaches which mainstream rights and responsibilities in a way that promotes transparency and accountability.
