A SILOBELA man who dumped his brother s corpse at the home of persons suspected of having killed him, demanding to be paid three cattle before he could bury his sibling, has been jailed for extortion. BY BLESSED MHLANGARemigio Sibanda (47) was slapped with a 90-day jail term when he pleaded guilty to extorting Julia Mbangwa, whose sons he accused of killing his brother.Kwekwe magistrate Vimbai Mutukwa slapped Sibanda with an effective 60-day term, but spared him jail after giving the extortionist the option to pay a $200 fine.She added another 30 days which she suspended on condition Sibanda restitutes the beast he had received from Mbangwa.The State, led by Michelle Daraja, told the court that on March 22, Sibanda, acting in common purpose with his father Mexen Sibanda, who is at large, went to Mbangwa s homestead and dumped Mlungisi s body.The accused and his father claimed Mbangwa s three sons had killed Mlungisi during a fight on March 16 and demanded to be paid three cattle before they could remove the body for burial.The two left the body of the deceased in Mbangwa s kitchen after she had only paid one out of the three cattle demanded as compensation.In passing judgment on Monday, Mutukwa ordered the police to immediately remove the body which had been lying in the kitchen for eight days as the Sibandas refused to budge until they were paid.Since March 22, Mbangwa was now staying with her neighbours in Village 2, Phaka in the Chief Malisa area, after fleeing her home because she could not stay with the corpse.
