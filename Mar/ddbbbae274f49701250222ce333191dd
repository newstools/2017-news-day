Elias MamboLocal Government minister Saviour KasukuwereThis came a day after the paper alleged Kasukuwere tried to sabotage the women&#8217;s league demonstrations against Bulawayo provincial affairs minister, Eunice Sandi Moyo and Hurungwe East MP, Sarah Mahoka.Speaking to journalists on the sidelines of a Command Agriculture field day at Chaminuka vocational training centre in Mt Darwin, Kasukuwere said: &#8220;I want to make it clear that the Herald is a factional paper and their aim is to split the party.&#8221; &#8220;I am not (Joice) Mujuru and I want to take them head on. They write stories based on sources who have interests,&#8221; he said.Kasukuwere claimed Information Minister Chris Mushowe was warned by President Robert Mugabe in Cabinet a fortnight ago over the alleged biased reporting. This is no longer a national paper but a factional mouthpiece and we are not scared to take them head on. We will fight them to the bitter end,&#8221; he said.
