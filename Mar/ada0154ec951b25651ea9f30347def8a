DYNAMOS capacity to mount a serious Castle Lager Premier Soccer League title challenge will be put to the test when they host FC Platinum at the National Sports Stadium in their first instalment of the 2017 season. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKAThe Glamour Boys were decimated by the departure of several key players, who left for greener pastures with first-choice goalkeeper Tatenda Mukuruva being snapped up by South African Premiership side Cape Town City.Other stars who left include Godknows Murwira and Dominic Mukandi, who joined Ngezi Platinum, while Brett Amidu signed for FC Platinum.This left coach Lloyd Mutasa with the big task of assembling a new team and he had to dig deep to include new blood in the squad.And the Dynamos gaffer yesterday said they had done their best to come up with a squad that can compete at the top level. He said he was hoping for a good start. We have done our best to come up with a squad that can compete at this level. This first match will help us gauge our preparedness. Any team would want to start off with a win and we are not an exception. A positive result will be obviously good for us as an institution going forward, he said.FC Platinum dominated their meetings last season with the Zvishavane-side edging the Glamour Boys 1-0 at Rufaro in May before they completed a double with a 2-0 win at Mandava Stadium. As they travel to the capital for the Sunday clash, Norman Mapeza s men will be looking to continue their dominance over the Glamour Boys while their new recruit Amidu would want to prove a point against his former paymasters.On the other hand, Mutasa will be banking on the experience of skipper Ocean Mushure, Elisha Muroiwa, Masimba Mambare and Denver Mukamba as he seeks to get off to a good start in his push for the championship, which eluded them last term.They also have in their ranks Cameroon international Ntouba Epoupa Christian Joel, whom they believe could solve their goal-scoring problems.Dynamos have tough opening fixtures which include a trip to Triangle next weekend. They host Premiership returnees Black Rhinos in week three before embarking on another trip to the Colliery to face Hwange.They face Caps United in the first Harare derby set for week seven and after that, they travel to Bulawayo for another high-profile clash with Highlanders.
