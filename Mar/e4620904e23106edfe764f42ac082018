FOUR dance students from M and M Dance Factory have secured tickets to partake in the auditions for the World Championship of Performing Arts 2017 edition set for the United States on July 9, but only one of them will travel due to financial constraints. BY TATIRA ZWINOIRAMelany and Mitzi CarruthersThe students, Anna French, Toby French, Amani Khalpey and Kelly Midlane, were selected after successful auditions held recently by the Zimbabwe Championship of Performing Arts and needed a total of $9 000 for each student to travel to Hollywood.M and M Dance Factory co-director Mitzi Carruthers told NewsDay on the sidelines of the Indian Women s Association Zimbabwe last weekend that only one of the students would be able to attend the US auditions due to financial constraints. I know there is a future for dance with our kids in this country. Unfortunately, Zimbabwe has not yet embraced it for us to bring international orders to expose our kids to the international community, she said. I have four kids that just made the auditions for the World Championships and one of them, Kelly, is going to go to California. Mitzi established the M and M Dance Factory with her daughter, Melany, in 2009 as a platform to provide underprivileged children with a chance to pursue dancing as a means to empower themselves.Melany said they had been struggling to get sponsorship, although the students parents have extended their support. Recently, we just went to Malawi and we could have not done that without the support of our parents. We hope that in the future more business communities can help to support, she said.
