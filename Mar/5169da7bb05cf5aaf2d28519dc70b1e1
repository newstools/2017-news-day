GOSPEL musician Caroline Mujokoro is set to end her sabbatical with a double package of a Live DVD and CD recording called X-Trim Worship 1 on Saturday at the 7 Arts Theatre in Harare after starving her fans for five years. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOCarol MujokoroMujokoro, who is now a pastor, told NewsDay yesterday that her absence from the music scene was due to piracy, which has made it difficult for music projects to be self-sustaining. We expect the music to be self-sustaining. If we borrow money for album one, sales from the album should be able to fund the production of album two and so on, but if nothing tangible is coming from the album sales, one has to raise the funds for every album, and that is always difficult, she said.The Chitungwiza-bred singer said it was important to conscientise fans not to buy pirated music. Our fans must know that as long as they buy counterfeit products, they will not get new music as often as they should from their beloved artistes. We often meet our fans who complain that it has been long since we last gave them a new album, but they must understand that as long as they buy pirated products, it will always be difficult for an artiste to fund the next project, she said.Mujokoro said they are redoing the project they had initially recorded in February last year after losing the material before it was released. The X-Trim Worship 1 is a project which has delayed by more than 12 months, she said, adding that the album will have 15 tracks.Mujokoro urged gospel music fans to come in their numbers for the event, saying it is an experience they would like to share with their fans.Songs on the album include Tenda Mwari, Tawona Kunaka Kwenyu and Jesu Idombo.This Mujokoro s 12th album after Mufudzi Wangu (1992), Ndinokudai Jesu (1995), Vimba NaJehovah (1997), Kutenda (1999), Ropa raJesu (1996), NdiMwari Baba (1999), Jehovah Wakanaka (2001), Ngatimunamate (2003), Mufudzi Wakanaka (2004), Nditungamirei (2006), Kunamata Kungwara (2007) and Champions (2011).
