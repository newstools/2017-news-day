The decision to join striking doctors by public hospitals nurses to pile pressure on President Robert Mugabe s cash-strapped government to honour its undertaking to pay the 2016 bonuses will surely paralyse the country s health sector, and with dire consequences. Comment: NewsDay EditorPresident Robert MugabeClearly, the majority of Zimbabweans unable to afford private health institutions will no doubt bear the brunt of Mugabe s administration s failure to improve nurses working conditions.Although many would sympathise with medical professionals, who for years, have had to work for a pittance regardless of the priceless services they offer to the nation against a background of a collapsing health delivery system and unpalatable working conditions, the government must get the important message.The fact that government continues to promise to pay civil servants bonuses every year that passes, without heeding the red line is surely bound to be disastrous. A sane government leadership would have realised that the economic challenges Zimbabwe is facing have redlined the bonuses to the civil servants, and therefore could be postponed to a later period.We believe bonuses are supposed to be paid out only in cases of exceptional work done rather than as a blanket payment regardless. What a joke, the Zanu PF regime is!Yet, we have no doubt the populist decision was made to appease civil servants, who are frustrated by Mugabe s 37-year leadership.It is no secret that the government is cash-strapped and for the past two or so years, has been struggling to pay its bloated workforce. In moments of austerity such as the one Zimbabwe is currently going through thanks to Zanu PF s failed economic policies there are certain privileges that must be stripped off for the good of the nation. But alas, the opposite is true. We believe the decision by nurses, two weeks after doctors had taken off their stethoscopes, is emblematic of the governance void that Zimbabwe has been experiencing for decades, and there is no hope whatsoever of the winds of change blowing as long as the country s intransigent leadership remains in power.Zimbabwe needs new brooms to sweep away the mess produced by the current leadership.Perhaps the saddest thing is that the country s leadership continues to enjoy obscene privileges and perks at a time when the majority of government employees are caught between a rock and a hard place.The medical field is very sensitive because it involves human lives and how government will respond to this challenge will prove whether or not the country s leadership took power as a means to an end or an end in itself.Zimbabweans definitely hope it is not the latter.And when the country has to rely on student nurses and doctors, something must give as a matter of urgency.It is hoped, too, that government will desist from the habit of making pie-in-the-sky promises. Indeed, the Zanu PF leadership need to look themselves in the mirror.
