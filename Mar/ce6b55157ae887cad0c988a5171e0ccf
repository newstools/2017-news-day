We have a lot of ambassadors today to enable us to push products from one platform to another so that they can be able to expand, and create an enabling environment for them to prosper and linking them with bigger markets. We are also working on ensuring that we can have these platforms happening on a daily basis because in Zimbabwe, we have women who have passion and determination. We have got women from Mutare Matabeleland, Kwekwe and Binga to promote their products. So this platform has been created for these women to support their products, she said.Machingauta said that WFS was working with other organisations and government departments to ensure that they improve the quality of products made by women. We are also working with the government to ensure that we improve the quality of women s products. We are also working with different organisations to move products from Zimbabwe to other countries. Currently, we are exporting baobab bark products from 20 different communities in Zimbabwe to Australia and Britain, she said.An official from the Palestine embassy, Manar Alghar emphasised the importance of networking among small-to-medium enterprises from different countries in order to share ideas. Palestine will bring some of its businesspeople to come and share their ideas with their Zimbabwean counterparts in October, Algar said.The exhibition was attended by women from Mutare, Kwekwe and Manicaland to showcased their products.
