DYNAMOS have been dealt a huge blow ahead of the new Premier Soccer League (PSL) season after two of their regular players Elisha Muroiwa and Wisdom Mutasa ditched the former champions for Tanzania. BY HENRY MHARAThe duo were yesterday unveiled by newly-promoted Tanzanian Vodacom League side Singida United, to join compatriot Tafadzwa Kutinyu, who signed for the club last week.Reports from Tanzania suggested that Muroiwa and Mutasa both signed two-year contracts. Financial details were not immediately available, but the club is well sponsored by a betting company.Dynamos manager Richard Chihoro confirmed the two players were in Tanzania for talks with a view to joining a new club. They left yesterday morning and from my understanding they will sign and come back. They will probably go in July, Chihoro said.However, the reports from Tanzania are stating otherwise. The two are expected to join their new club immediately for a pre-season training camp in Ghana to join the rest of the squad.Singida United secretary-general Abdulrahman Simba confirmed the capture of the two players. We have appointed a new coach who has to sign great players capable of playing and giving the team victory. They ve finished with them so now we will register three foreign players and all come from Zimbabwe, Sima said.The departure of Muroiwa and Mutasa, who had been included in Dynamos 30-man squad submitted to the PSL last week, is a huge blow for the Harare giants who were hoping to build their squad on such senior players after a host of other first team players left.Notable faces that left include goalkeeper Tatenda Mukuruva, Sydney Linyama, Steven Alimenda, Rodreck Mutuma, Godknows Murwira and Dominic Chungwa, among others.Singida is mentored by former Young Africans coach Hans Pluijm, where Thabani Kamusoko and Donald Ngoma are based, and the Dutchman has not made secret of his desire to bring the two along.
