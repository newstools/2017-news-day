The two tracks seem to have won the hearts of many.Performing with a live band, his repertoire comprises mbira, keyboards, drums and guitars, which make fans sway to the melody. His playlist includes old tracks such as Ambuya, Tau Akatozvipengerawo Zvake, Amai Maria, Hapana Asingafe and Ndageza Maoko fused with new songs from the forthcoming album.Known for his trademark chant Pachedu when on stage, Mteki has been roping in other musicians in his shows, paticularly those who perform different genres to cater for a divergent audience.In Manicaland, he partnered sungura exponent Obvious Mutani of the Sungano Express, who did not disappoint either.
