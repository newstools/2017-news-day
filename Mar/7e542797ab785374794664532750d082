The Lord himself declared right at the creation of this world, It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make him a helper suitable for him . Marriage is a good and sacred estate that gives humankind happiness, he said.Chiza warned those seeking marriage partners to be patient and careful because the marital institution could lead to success or failure in life depending on how it is handled.
