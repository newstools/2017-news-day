LOCAL roots reggae musician, Joe Wailer, is set to launch his sixth album titled The Solution in Harare at the end of the month, according to his publicist Brenna Matendere. BY ARTS REPORTERMatendere told NewsDay that the Gweru-based musician would be in the capital for the much-awaited launch.She said the launch would mark the comeback of the Chant Down Babylon hitmaker onto the music arena. The launch will be the great thing ever to happen to the reggae industry because it will be spread into three days, Thursday, Friday and Saturday of the last week of March, he said. That has not happened before but will be necessary so that the launch becomes a reggae weekend full of fun. We will soon be announcing effective dates and the venues. World-acclaimed music promoter, Evolutionary Management and Music Promotions, has endorsed The solution.The New York-based company vowed to put the singer onto the global map.Theresa Mama T Kemp, the EMMP chief executive, said the eight-track album was released in New York last month and is doing well on top radio stations.Popularly known as Uncle Joe by his fans, Wailer rose to stardom with hits like Chant Down Babylon, Beautiful Zimbabwe, Judgement Day and Unite Africa. His music touches on topical societal issues.Wailer also identifies with the life of the ghetto sufferer and rural poor. In 2012, he was invited to perform in Jamaica at the Marcus Garvey Commemorations where he shared the stage with celebrated reggae torch bearers such as Luciano, Morgan Heritage and Sizzla Kalonje. The objective of Joe Wailer s mission right from the date of the launch going forward will be to revive roots reggae. We have seen some artistes playing just cover songs, while there has been a dearth of reggae roots singers themselves so that gap will now be covered, Matendere said.
