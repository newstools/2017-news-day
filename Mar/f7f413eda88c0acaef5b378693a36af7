BY PRECIOUS CHIDAChiedza ZiyambeRoad show auditions will take place across the European country in April ahead of the main show meant to celebrate Zimbabwean culture, beauty and pride, according to Ziyambe.The organisers granted Ziyambe the licence on the strength of their interest in her work and investments in the Zimbabwe Fashion Showcase (ZFS), a platform through which she collaborated with designers, models and creatives.Ziyambe, who is based in the United Kingdom, admitted this was a tall order, but it provided the country with a rare opportunity to market its culture and talents. I know this is going to be a hard job, but I am no stranger to hard work. Miss World Zimbabwe UK will be the perfect opportunity to showcase Zimbabwean talent, fashion and culture, whilst also redefining the idea of pageantry. We are looking for women who can be icons for their country, she said. Contestants in the pageant will be afforded an opportunity to learn important life skills, stimulate their minds and become proud representatives of their country of origin. The winner and her two princesses will be flown to Zimbabwe to contest for the Miss Zimbabwe 2017 title, the winner of which will participate in Miss World.Those interested in the competition will attend the casting road shows at Nottingham- Crown Plaza and Mercure Manchester Piccadilly, Portland Street.
