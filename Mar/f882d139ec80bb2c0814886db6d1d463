The Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ) is courting pan African carrier ASKY Airlines, which is set to expand its footprint outside West Africa. BY NDAMU SANDUThe airline covers 22 destinations in 20 countries in West and Central Africa.CAAZ general manager, David Chawota told NewsDay last week that the authority wants to capitalise on the airline s expansion plans to lure the carrier to fly into Victoria Falls. ASKY is on an expansion drive and we are expecting that could be one (airline CAAZ wants to woo). We are looking forward to its entry in Victoria Falls. We are out there trying to woo them, he said.ASKY was founded in 2008 on the initiative of West African governments with its headquarters in Lome, Togo. It was created by regional institutions: the Bank for Investment and Development, the West African Development Bank and Ecobank Group.The push to lure ASKY comes as CAAZ has successfully courted three airlines that will start flights into the country in the first half of the year.Africa s largest carrier, Ethiopian Airlines will introduce four weekly flights into Victoria Falls beginning March 26. Kenya Airways will introduce three weekly flights into the resort town beginning May 18.RwandAir is set to fly daily to Harare with effect from April 1.In addition, South African Airways has introduced a bigger plane, Airbus A330-200, on the Victoria Falls to Johannesburg route.Tourism experts say the more the airlines into a destination, the more accessible that place becomes. Accessibility is critical in destination marketing. At its peak in 1999, 42 airlines used to fly into Zimbabwe. The number included eight cargo planes. Currently 20 airlines are flying into Zimbabwe.
