THE Old Mutual Heath Streak Cricket Academy has been turned into a trust with the Zimbabwe Cricket coach appointed the president. BY FORTUNE MBELEThe announcement was made by academy chief executive officer Joseph Rego at a press briefing yesterday which Streak attended. The Old Mutual Heath Streak Cricket Academy has been converted to a Trust and the former Zimbabwe cricket captain and national coach Heath Streak has been unanimously elected unopposed as the Trust s first president, Rego said. Streak said he was grateful for the appointment. We are pushing Joseph (Rego) to expand our academy to Harare and to help it grow. Hopefully it is something we can realize this year through Joseph s marketing ability. My role will be basically to oversee the function of the secretariat and not the operations but for accountability and transparency, Streak said.Rego will be shuffling between Harare and Bulawayo to try and source funding for non-profit making academy which has an objective of churning out future cricket stars. With an eye towards the academy s development platform, the Old Mutual Heath Streak Cricket Trust has been targeting strategic alliances with high profile local corporate firms and multi-nationals as part of its growth strategy, Rego said.This year, the trust intends to build a pavilion with changing rooms and showers and construct accommodation quarters for visiting schools, institutions and academies from local and across the world.
