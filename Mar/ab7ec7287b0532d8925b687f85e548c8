AFRO-FUSION star, Willis Wataffi, set Joina City on fire on Saturday afternoon with an electrifying performance of his song Tsitsi Dzake alongside gospel musician, Sebastian Magacha who features on the song during the DStv Thank You Concert. BY PRECIOUS CHIDAWillis WataffiThe jam-packed show in Harare also saw Magacha wooing crowds with his hugely popular tracks, Ridza Bosvo and One Plus One, leaving fans clamouring for more when he left the podium. Wataffi used the concert, which was organised to thank DStv subscribers for staying connected to the television services provider, to unveil his 13-track gospel album, Songs of David, which was launched in Dubai last year.The multi-award winner was also supported by the Believers Choir, who were the back-up vocalists as well as Tytan, who featured in the track God is Real and Abraham Mchesa, who featured on Ngaavongwe.Wataffi said recording a gospel album was the fulfilment of a long-cherished dream, but did not mark his departure from Qaya Roots music. Recording a gospel album may have been a calling I was not heeding, but it finally caught up with me. However, the misconception that I will become a gospel artiste is ridiculous, he said.Wataffi showcased his video for the song Ngaavongwe at the concert and said he was going to release four more videos from the album. I am also going to do four more videos from the Songs of David album, which you are certainly going to love, he said. Wataffi rose to fame as the lead singer of Afrika Revenge, releasing hit tracks such as Anochengeta, before going solo in 2007. He has released hits including Rusambo and Nzira masanga.
