The challenges that have contributed to the experiences by the beneficiaries ranged from the long and cumbersome administrative and bureaucratic claiming procedures, lack of information, capacity and resources among the beneficiaries to complete the requirements, Moyo said. The unclaimed funds are being held in various South African social security and compensation institutions. These funds have not been claimed by former mineworkers and dependents from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique, Lesotho and Swaziland. He said the documentary, which was launched in Pretoria on Tuesday, provided an overview of the challenges of the miners and their families. The documentary emphasizes the magnitude of the challenges of ex-miners and beneficiaries to access their benefits. The documentary also shows the positive efforts by various stakeholders to disburse the benefits, Moyo said.
