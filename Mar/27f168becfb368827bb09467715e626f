PRINCE Edward High School has established a platform to showcase and nurture youngsters artistic talent through music, ahead of the inaugural High Schools Music Festival scheduled for April 1. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKOFestival co-ordinator Elizabeth Gama-Phiri said they had already sent out invitations to participants and eight schools have since confirmed they will be part of the fiesta. Unfortunately we are starting with eight schools that showed interest. However, we, did not cast our net very wide as this is an inaugural event and we had limited time to visit all provinces, she said.The genres, she said, will include marimba, mbira, modern instruments and pipes.Churchill High School, Heritage School, St Johns College, Midlands Christian College, Watershed, St Georges College and Tynwald Primary School are expected to participate.Gama-Phiri said she was hopeful that the festival will grow big and said in future they would engage a few primary schools. Just as our rugby festival started small, but now has over 70 schools participating nationally and regionally, we hope to pull in more schools next year, especially from high-density suburbs so as to grow, she said. Although it is for high schools we will endeavour to pull in a few primary schools at every festival to showcase talented pupils they have as well. She said the festival seeks to create opportunities for youths that include provision of scholarships to any identified talent. We hope starting from next year we will be able to provide scholarships to outstanding musicians for further education in music. We want to create a platform were our arts pupils are scouted for further development in their creative talent, Gama-Phiri said.Tickets for the event are available at Sopranos, Avondale and Prince Edward School at $5 for adults and $2 pupils in uniform.
