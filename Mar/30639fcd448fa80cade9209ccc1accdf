THE country s most-sought-after master of jest, Carl Joshua Ncube, yesterday feasted on President Robert Mugabe s penchant for travelling outside the country, describing the 93-year-old strongman as a frequent visitor to Zimbabwe. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOCarl Joshua NcubeNcube recently courted controversy at the National Arts Merit Awards ceremony, when some of his politically incorrect jokes about Mugabe, Zanu PF and ZTV were censored by the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation television. The award-winning comedian yesterday took to social media Facebook with a post insinuating that Mugabe was now a visitor to the country.The comedian urged Zimbabweans in the Diaspora to take a leaf from Mugabe and frequently visit their homeland. Love how President Mugabe is encouraging people to #visitZimbabwe from time to time . . . #leadingByExample, he wrote.Mugabe on Sunday made a stop-over in Harare from Singapore where he had reportedly gone for medical attention, but immediately left for Ghana early yesterday morning.Fans who responded to the Facebook post hailed the comedian for his satire, describing him as one of the best comedians, whose stunts really hit home with their truths.In the first half of last year Mugabe was said to have gobbled $80 million on foreign trips, clocking 200 000km in the air. Last year alone he went to Singapore more than 10 times in most cases with an unusually huge entourage gobbling a chunk of money from the country s cash-strapped government.
