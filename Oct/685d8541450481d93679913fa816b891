We achieve this by bringing prominent artistes like this time, we will host Jah Prayzah and Winky D. Jah Prayzah couldn’t have come at a better time as he has just released his new album. We want the people of Masvingo to sample it and have their say. Winky D is an all-time favourite,” he said. Ngarande said their aim was to ensure that the tourist town of Masvingo had an opportunity to host some of the biggest names in the music industry. He said musicians based in the province will also perform at the festival and these include Ras Caleb, Alchemy, Baba Raah, MC Kuleza, DJ Maestro and DJ Vasco.
