RISING contemporary musician Faith Zawadi Jori put up an electrifying performance at The Volt nightclub in Harare where she jolted fans off their seats to the dance floor on a chilly Friday evening. BY ALBERT MASAKAFaith Jori performing at the Volt on Friday Picture: Kush CarterZawadi, who was warming the stage for rising Afro-pop fusion musician, Gary Tight, got off to a tepid start during her nearly two-hour performance with the song Ndimirire, off her debut album Shaina a cleverly produced fusion of different genres which she dropped in January.After singing old hits like Furuwa by the late great Tairos Tendaupenyu, the predominantly young crowd quickly got fond of her voice as the night progressed and that, in turn, bolstered her confidence.The song Baba na Mai dedicated to her parents in appreciation of their love, care and support proved to be a hit with the revellers, and Shaina was the icing on the cake for a memorable night for the songstress.Gary Tight, who said he would launch a new album soon, did not disappoint either, sampling songs from the forthcoming album and old hits by his father, Willom Tight.The young musician started singing at a tender age, under his father s mentorship, and has performed at various shows alongside prominent artistes including Oliver Mtukudzi, Sulumani Chimbetu, Jah Prayzah, Alexio Kawara, Leonard Zhakata and the late Chiwoniso Maraire. Gary, who fronts a six-member outfit called Zion Originated, is reputed for his proficiency on the mbira and guitar after enrolling at the Zimbabwe College of Music in 2015.
