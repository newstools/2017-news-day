BY ABIGAIL MATSIKIDZESelmor Mtukudzi and husband Tendai Manatsa The feel-good track was the first featuring the couple in four years after their decision to develop their individual careers in 2013. Selmor told NewsDay that it was fun working on the song and its video and hailed MacDee, Simba Gee and Hwamande Dance Troupe for helping to produce the breath-taking piece of art. It s been great working with my husband, Simba Gee, Macdee and the Hwamanda Dance Troupe, she said. My husband is very supportive and l enjoyed working with him because we have similar views on most of the things we do. She said the responses from viewers were encouraging and she was happy that people were appreciative of her work. I love how people are responding to our new single. The response and comments from my fans are awesome. They love it, she said.Hangasa is a Shona name which means delicious meal and in the video, Selmor featured one of the country s best traditional dance groups, Hwamanda Dance Troupe, which was voted the best in the Indian Ocean Island s 2013 carnival.She skilfully creates a perfect setting for the natural Zimbabwean Shona musical culture, a mixture of her great voices and colourful sentiments to unleash what is possibly one of the best videos produced this year so far and with strange flawlessness.
