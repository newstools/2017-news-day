ZVISHAVANE Town Council chairperson, Esau Gwatipedza Dube, has been fired after a three-member government probe team found him guilty of corruption and gross misconduct and recommended that he be relieved of his duties. BY Stephen ChadengaTown secretary, Tinoda Mukutu confirmed the development yesterday. The determination to relieve him (Dube) of his duties both as council chairperson and councillor was made on June 5 by the tribunal and it was effected on June 6, Mukutu said.In January this year, Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere suspended Dube and appointed a probe team to investigate him on allegations of corruption and gross misconduct after he unprocedurally suspended Mukutu.Dube was also accused of engaging private lawyers in fighting Mukutu at the Labour Court instead of using council lawyers in contravention of the Urban Council s Act.He was also accused of delaying the approval of the council budget by refusing to sign Mukutu s performance contract, resulting in council running without a budget for eight months.Mukutu was later reinstated following the intervention of the Labour Court.Several MDC-T-led councils are crying foul, accusing Kasukuwere of interference and seeking to micro-manage their affairs, but the latter has insisted he has a duty to protect ratepayers from corrupt local authorities.
