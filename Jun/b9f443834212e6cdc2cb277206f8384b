THE Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) has been taken to the High Court by a local company, Manica Africa, trading as Manica Zimbabwe (Pvt) Ltd, which is seeking to recover over $16 500 for the handling and storage facilities offered to the country s soccer governing body for its artificial turf six years ago. BY CHARLES LAITONManica Zimbabwe filed the summons claiming $16 530,98 against Zifa on June 22 this year and the latter is yet to respond to the litigation.According to the court papers, Manica Zimbabwe said in November 2011, the football governing body sought space for its container with artificial turf for storage at the firm s premises, which space was granted.Through its lawyers Mutuso, Taruvinga and Mhiribidi Attorneys, the firm said for the period extending from November 2013 to September 23, 2014, Zifa was billed a total of $16 530,98, but since then, it had not paid anything to date. Despite demand, defendant (Zifa) has failed and/or refused to pay plaintiff (Manica Zimbabwe) the sum of $16 530 for storage of its container, the lawyers said. Wherefore plaintiff s claim against defendant is for payment of the sum of $16 530 for handling and storage charges supplied by plaintiff at the defendant s instance and request, interest thereon at the prescribed rate from date of demand and costs of the suit on a legal practitioner-client scale and collection commission as provided under Law Society of Zimbabwe. The matter is still pending.
