THE country s flagship beauty contest, Miss World Zimbabwe (MWZ), makes a return on July 22 after it was shelved last year, amid claims prospective beauty queens had failed to meet the expected standards. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOAnnie Grace MutambuMiss Zimbabwe Trust s failure to send a representative to the 66th edition of the Miss World pageant held in the United States last year irked local modelling stakeholders.The trust, led by Marry Mubaiwa-Chiwenga, insisted it failed to get the requisite number of models to contest during the scouting process done over eight months.The trust s spokesperson, Tendai Chirau, announced yesterday, that the pageant returns this year. Miss Zimbabwe Trust, the licence holders of Miss World in Zimbabwe and organisers of Miss World Zimbabwe, informs the nation that Miss World Zimbabwe 2016/2017 edition will be held on Saturday July 22, 2017, at the Borrowdale Brooke Golf Course, he said in a statement.Chirau said this year s edition of the pageant was a tribute to the late MWZ patron, Kiki Divaris, who contributed to the growth of the local modelling industry, and will be held under the theme, Celebrating Beauty through the Eyes of Our Late Icon, Kiki Divaris.Chirau said contestants for the premier event will be selected through auditions to be conducted from June 29 to July 1 at the trust s offices in Harare.The 13 aspiring models shortlisted at last year s scouting process will be re-auditioned, although they have been assured of automatic entry, while former Miss World Zimbabwe finalists will not be eligible to participate.The trust entered into an agreement with organisers of Miss World Zimbabwe United States of America, Miss World Zimbabwe United Kingdom, Miss World Zimbabwe South Africa and Miss World Zimbabwe Canada that they will each send three representatives to the MWZ boot camp scheduled to run from July 3 to 23.
