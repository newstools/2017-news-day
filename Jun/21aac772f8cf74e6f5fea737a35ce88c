The Zanu PF politburo is expected to meet today, where growing factional fights, countrywide demonstrations against political commissar Saviour Kasukuwere and internal polls to choose a substantive chairman in Masvingo are likely to dominate proceedings. BY RICHARD CHIDZAZanu PF spokesperson Simon Khaya Moyo would neither confirm nor deny a meeting of the ruling party s administrative body was on the cards. I would not know whether there is a politburo meeting this week. Such meetings are organised by the secretary for administration, Ignatius Chombo, and the President (Robert Mugabe), he said. As regards the report on the demonstrations (against Kasukuwere), please talk to the chairperson of the committee (Jacob Mudenda). But a politburo member confirmed the ruling party s top administrative body would meet today. The notices are out, but the agenda has not been circulated, he told NewsDay. Chombo was not available for comment.Zanu PF is bitterly divided between two distinct factions, one declaring allegiance to Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, and another known as G40, which has been oscillating between different personalities in a bid to present a factional face as Mugabe s health problems mount and age takes its toll.The ruling party was rocked to its very foundations when demonstrations broke out across the country in which party activists demanded that Kasukuwere be relieved of his duties as political commissar.Kasukuwere was accused of plotting to topple Mugabe.A committee headed by Speaker of the National Assembly, Mudenda, was set up to investigate the demonstrations and the authenticity of the allegations against Kasukuwere.Mudenda this week said he would be ready to present his findings when the politburo sits . I have said it before, we are ready and whenever the politburo sits, we will be ready, he said.
