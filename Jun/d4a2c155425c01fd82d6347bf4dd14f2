ZIMBABWEAN football champions Caps United have been boosted by the return to fitness of some of their stars including Tafadzwa Fire Rusike and goalkeeper Jorum Muchambo, as they face off against Yadah FC in a Castle Lager Premiership match at Morris Depot this afternoon. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKATafadzwa RusikeCaps United coach Lloyd Chitembwe said the injured players had been responding well to treatment and would be available for selection, which would give him more options ahead of today s encounter. Our preparations have been going on very well. The injured players have responded well to treatment and should be available for selection. We are looking forward to the match against Yadah, he said.The Green Machine have put behind last week s defeat to Libya s Al Ahli Tripoli, which diminished their chances of progressing to the last eight of the African Champions League, to focus on defending the domestic title.Chitembwe s men are, however, playing catch-up, having played just eight matches in the campaign thus far due to their commitments in the Champions League.They have 13 points from those matches, having won three, drawn four and lost one.The Harare giants will be looking to vent disappointment of last week s defeat on Yadah.Yadah have been struggling in recent matches, having won just one in their last five, a 3-0 triumph over Triangle, and lost three, while they drew one, leaving them fourth from the bottom with 13 points.Yadah had a storming start to the campaign, putting together five successive wins, including a shock victory over Ngezi Platinum.But a defeat against Caps United today could further dampen their hopes of surviving relegation.
