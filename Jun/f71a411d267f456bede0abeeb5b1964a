GWERU residents have rejected council plans to introduce prepaid water meters, arguing that the programme was a sinister ploy to deny them access to water. BY Stephen ChadengaCouncil recently indicated that it was scouting for partners to upgrade its water reticulation system and install pre-paid water meters as part of measures to boost revenue collection.The issue was initially raised in January this year, but set aside before the city fathers revisited it early this month. The Gweru Residents Forum (GRF) received with dismay plans by the (mayor Charles) Chikozho-led council to introduce pre-paid water meters for the residents of Gweru, GRF director Charles Mazorodze said. It is saddening to realise that the people whom we elected to represent our interests as Gweru residents are at the forefront of ensuring exclusion of the poor, unemployed and the senior citizens from consuming water. While we appreciate that residents have an obligation of paying for their water usage, the current water and property tax regimes charging in excess of between $100 and $150 are beyond the reach of many residents who are generally unemployed. Mazorodze said council should come up with a proper billing system, not the current one based on estimates.He said the local authority should stop water disconnections, but engage defaulting residents for a lasting solution over unpaid bills.Chikozho could not be reached for comment yesterday as was said to be out of office.
