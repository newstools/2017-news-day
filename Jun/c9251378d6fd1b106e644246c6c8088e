BUS Stop TV comedian, Samantha Gonyeti Kureya is a courageous woman, who has no qualms about tempting fate. BY PRECIOUS CHIDAGonyetiAt a time when many local comedians are struggling to draw crowds to their shows, Gonyeti will dare the gods when she launches a new solo comedy show, Meet the People, on June 24 at the New Ambassador Hotel.Across town, at Jazz 24/7, fellow comedian Doc Vikela was early this month forced to scale down his Laugh out Harare Stand-Up Comedy Club which was held once every week to once a month after it failed to attract the anticipated crowds three months after its launch.Bustop co-founder and producer, Lucky Aaroni told NewsDay yesterday that they were anticipating better prospects with their show, which will see Gonyeti rubbing shoulders with fellow comedians Fellistas Mai Titi Muruta and Bulawayo duo of Ms Dee and Mandla Da. Following the previous shows that have not been successful, we can only hope for the best because we have done our best in preparation and even the comedians have confirmed that they have been preparing for the show and have promised new materials, he said.Aaroni said the idea of the show is to circuit Zimbabwe as female comedians. The idea of the Meet the People comedy show is to tour Zimbabwe with female comedians on the line up and Gonyeti as the headline of the acts. However, we do not have a lot of female comedians on board so we will be working with both women who are already doing stand-up comedy and a few male comedians, he said.Aaroni said plans were underway to stage a show in Mutare, but there were still seeking sponsorship and other forms of partnerships before the dream could materialise, but commitments have already been made with Nash Paints and Senditoo. Our next destination will be in Mutare, but we are still running around looking for sponsorship and partnership to be able to stage other shows around Zimbabwe, he said.Songbird, Cindy Munyavi will be on board to entertain the guests, with DJ Lynaness on the turntables.Gonyeti s rose to prominence in 2008 when she featured on a local drama, Kusika Moto, before featuring in a number of other television and theatre productions.
