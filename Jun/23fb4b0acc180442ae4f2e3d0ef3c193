THE driver of a South Africa-registered haulage truck, which sideswiped a Johannesburg-bound Proliner bus, killing 31 people on the spot and leaving 40 others injured near Chaka Business Centre along the Harare-Masvingo Highway, will be given a trial date tomorrow. BY STEPHEN CHADENGAEarly this month Mvuma resident magistrate Tayengwa Chibanda ruled that Regis Mangwari was fit to stand trial before yesterday setting June 29 as the day for confirmation of trial date.This was after Mangwari, through his lawyer, Passmore Mabukwa had applied to be mentally examined to establish if he could face prosecution alleging he was suffering from hallucinations.The accused was, however, examined by two medical doctors who certified that the driver was mentally fit to stand trial.The state alleges that on April 5, Mangwari was driving a Harare bound truck from Johannesburg.He said on approaching the 218km peg along the Harare-Masvingo Road, the accused&#8217;s truck which was carrying tyres side swiped a bus killing 31 people.The court further heard that accused acted negligently resulting in the loss of life.Bernard Nyoni is prosecuting.
