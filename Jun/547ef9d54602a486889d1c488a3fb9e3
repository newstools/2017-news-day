The trial of a Harare businessman, Nathan Mnaba, who is accused of fraudulently changing ownership of Norwich Trading Company, yesterday failed to kick off again. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEThe accused yesterday made an application to be given the State s vital documents in order to enable him to prepare for his defence.Mnaba also accused the State of deliberately withholding information which he needed to use in preparing his defence.Through his lawyers Dumisani Mtombeni and Nathaniel Chigoro, Mnaba argued prosecutor Clemence Chimbaru was shortchanging him by denying him access to documents, which information he said he was entitled to. Prosecutor Chimbaru knows for a fact that there are several documents that are in favour of the accused (Mnaba) which he is deliberately withholding from us. He is refusing to give us all police running diary logs and also refusing to give the accused vital information against him in order for him to prepare for the trial, Mtombeni said.According to the State case, on October 10, 2011, the complainant in the matter, Nighert Parween Savania, allegedly entered into an agreement of sale of shares of Norwich Trading Company with Mnaba.The total purchase price of 100 shares was pegged at $380 000. The terms of the agreement were that an initial payment of $250 000 was to be made on January 6, 2012, while the balance would be paid before the end of August 2012.However, Mnaba reportedly failed to pay the balance as agreed, prompting the complainant to engage her lawyers to resolve the issue.The State alleges in September 2012, the agreement for the sale of shares was eventually cancelled by Messrs Samukange and Partners Legal Practitioners, who were acting on behalf of Savania.On October 29, 2014, Mnaba allegedly proceeded to forge the annual company returns document and a special resolutions purporting that Savania had surrendered her issued share capital in his favour and other documents indicating that a Norwich director, the late Mahendra-Kumar Jivan, had resigned.After falsifying the documents, Mnaba allegedly lodged the fake papers with the Registrar of Companies.The State also alleges that sometime in 2014, Mnaba misrepresented to the Registrar of Deeds Office that he had lost the original title deeds, and applied for a replacement.According to the State, when Mnaba made the application he well knew that the original title deed was in Savania s possession, but after obtaining the title deed, he went on to mortgage Savania s house in Greystone Park with Stanbic Bank, where he acquired a $138 500 loan.
