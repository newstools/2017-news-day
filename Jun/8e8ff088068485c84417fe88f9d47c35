TAFADZWA Muzondo, the founder of a transformative arts organisation called Edzai Isu, will this Friday apprise stakeholders on the implementation of the Theatre PaBridge project implementation at Machipisa footbridge in Highfield. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOTafadzwa MuzondoMuzondo said the project is a community arts space developed after cleaning up a formerly disused footbridge in Highfield which had suffered years of neglect and abuse.Muzondo told NewsDay last week that the event was part of the Age of Wonderland 100 Days of Learning Project aimed to give stakeholders, including the community, local authorities and other concerned organisations, first-hand experience of developments at the bridge. We undertook the civic responsibility to clean up and re-claim the defunct bridge by converting the space into a functional and vibrant community arts venue, while maintaining the original purpose of it being a footbridge that gives people a creative incentive to use the bridge and not abuse it like had become the case, he said, adding that the project was done with support from Africalia Belgium.The field visit, scheduled for Friday, he said, would include the screening of a 20-minute documentary on the project and stakeholder dialogue. Muzondo said in the past four months they have consistently provided free family-friendly arts programming every Friday and Saturday afternoon at the bridge featuring dance, music, theatre, poetry and comedy. The project has been well received and has had social and economic benefits for local arts talent as well as the community at large, he said.Theatre PaBridge has hosted an international band, Sa Roy &#038; The Forest Jam Band courtesy of Harare International Festival of the Arts 2017 as well as Albert Nyathi, Kireni Zulu, Tryson Chimbetu, Progress Chipfumo, Edith WeUtonga, Douglas Chimbetu, Franco Slomo, Jiggaz and Talking Guitars.
