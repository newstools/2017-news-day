BY PRECIOUS CHIDAPauline MarereMarere said she was keen to clinch the crown despite being a foreigner. Being a foreigner in South Africa means extremely nothing to me and it does not limit me to do what I want or to achieve my goals and I am currently making the best out of a foreign land, she said. I believe in beauty with a purpose and l dedicated my life to serving the community and the world at large. I strongly believe that every woman is a queen and I want to inspire young ladies, tertiary students and those in high school as well. Marere has since embarked on a blanket and stationery campaign following a fire outbreak in Hout Bay in South Africa where people s houses and valuables went up in flames. The model said she was currently collecting blankets and fleeces as well as school stationery to be distributed around Western Cape.Marere said she was looking for assistance from both Zimbabwe and South Africa to donate and save the lives of the underprivileged. l believe it s the best opportunity for us all to join hands and blanket them and by doing so we will decrease the rate of cold related diseases, she said.The queen for Miss Universities SA will be crowned on September 30 in East London.
