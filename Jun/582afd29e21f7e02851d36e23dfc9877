Former South African leader, Thabo Mbeki at the weekend said people who have overstayed in power must go, remarks that should have an effect in Zimbabwe, where President Robert Mugabe has been in power for 37 years. Comment: NewsDay EditorHowever, Mbeki goes on to be dishonest and disingenuous, when he says only Zimbabweans can speak about when Mugabe must go, saying he would fight any South African who says Mugabe the Zimbabwean leader must go, saying this was none of their business.This was Mbeki at his deceptive worst, as he fails to realise that the world is quite interconnected and what happens in Zimbabwe affects South Africa and vice versa.If Mbeki is honest with himself, he will realise that his country has come up with many policies among them the Zimbabwe Special Permits and the Zimbabwe Special Dispensation Permits to accommodate Zimbabweans in South Africa, who are fleeing Mugabe s disastrous political and economic policies.Any South African should feel aggrieved that valuable taxpayers money, which could be used for other developmental programmes is being diverted to atone for the mistakes of the Zimbabwean government.If Zimbabwe was well governed and with a proper economy, there would be no need for multitudes estimated to be three million to cross the crocodile-infested Limpopo in search for jobs.Mbeki should accept that because of the Zimbabwean crises, there are undocumented migrants and this has an effect on South Africa s social spending.Thus, every South African is affected by Zimbabwe s failures and all of them deserve to have an opinion on the state of affairs north of the border.Whether they support Mugabe and Zanu PF or not, that is another story, but to say Zimbabwe is not the business of South Africans is quite delusory.As pointed out, we have become an interconnected world and with South Africa being Zimbabwe s major market for imports, Zimbabweans ought to be following what happens in that country and political upheavals are the business of everyone north of the Limpopo.To add onto that, Zimbabwe uses the rand, among a basket of currencies and, hence, cannot afford to be indifferent to what is happening in South Africa.Mbeki is often accused of having contributed to the Zimbabwe crises with his lack of decisive intermediation and it is easy to see why.South Africans cannot afford to have a see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil approach to Zimbabwe and Mugabe, because what happens north of the Limpopo has serious ramifications south of it.
