SECCESSIONIST party, Mthwakazi Liberation Front (MLF), has reshuffled its top leadership to give it a new impetus following the resignation of its founder, Fidelis Ncube in March 2016. BY SILAS NKALAParty spokesperson, Chrispen Nyoni said the reshuffle was announced at a recent meeting held in Gaborone, Botswana. Following a meeting that was held in Botswana s capital, Gaborone, MLF reshuffled some of its officers and also deployed some members across the leadership spectrum and that comes in as a first instance since the stepping down of Gen Nandinandi (Fidelis Ncube), last year, he said.Nyoni said Mpiyesizwe Guduza was appointed party president, deputised by Nkosinathi Mkhwananzi, who has been the national chairperson prior to his new role. The secretary-generalship remained in the hands of Andrea Sibanda and his deputy will be announced in due course. Edmos Khumalo took the national chairpersonship and is assisted by three provincial chairpersons, Nyoni said.The other executives are Gerald Smith (international relations secretary), Artwell Mnguni (treasurer), Duncan Dlamini (fundraising secterary), Mthetheleli Khumalo (acting national youth chair) and Thandi Nkomo (women affairs). Nyoni said Ncube succumbed to pressure and stepped down after President Robert Mugabe piled pressure on the Botswana government to censure him over his opposition political activities. After long deliberations with the Botswana security officials, Nandinandi resigned from MLF. It was not his choice, but a choice dictated to by Zanu PF through Botswana, Nyoni said. The Nandinandi saga tells us how some host countries view us. They view our restoration agenda as a destabilising exercise and turn a blind eye to what Zanu PF is doing to the Mthwakazi people, let alone talk about the Gukurahundi genocide. The movement had to operate without a leader for more than a year, he said.
