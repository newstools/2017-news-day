By providing citizens with the knowledge, skills and confidence to manage their personal finances well, financial education ensures that citizens are less likely to suffer fraud and losses.Through financial education, consumers are better able to judge the actual level of risk associated with financial products and are thus empowered to choose financial products that add value to their lives.Knowledgeable consumers are also more likely to understand their rights, report misconduct or inappropriate practices and influence product design by being able to better articulate their needs.In addition to educating consumers about the benefits and risks of financial products, the private sector also has a role to play in developing appropriate and simple products that meet the needs of the consumer and which enhance the quality of people s lives.To avoid increasing mistrust in the sector, financial service providers should discontinue the practice of selling products which they know consumers can afford, even if they do not entirely meet consumers needs.Regulators must take consumers needs into account when developing consumer protection policies and systems.For instance, the disclosures of terms and conditions of financial products may comply with regulation but are frequently so complex that the vast majority of consumers do not understand them fully.Moreover, regulators can establish financial education requirements for the industry to ensure that information is provided in an objective way and is not just a form of marketing.Promoting financial education in insuranceInsurance products play a pivotal role in curbing risks and in social and financial protection. In many countries, consumers have a low level of awareness of their risk exposure, do not sufficiently understand the concept of insurance and strongly distrust insurance service providers and products, largely due to the intangible nature of insurance products.Yet, insurance is often left out of national strategies and financial education programmes.Insurance education serves a dual purpose. It helps raise awareness of risks and to set correct expectations of how insurance can help cover those risks.In addition, it helps develop the knowledge, skills, and confidence that individuals need to adopt proactive and responsible behaviour regarding their risk exposure. Governments, regulators and supervisors, insurance associations, and providers all have a role to play in promoting the education of consumers on risk management strategies, including insurance.Kudzai is a strategic and innovative business consultant.
