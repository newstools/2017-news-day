LOCAL filmmakers Kuda Bryan Bwititi and Brian Kugara have launched a crowd funding campaign aimed at raising funds to finance the production of a documentary film titled Overspill which captures intriguing stories of moral decadence and child prostitution in Epworth under the banner of Creative Arts of Zimbabwe. BY PRECIOUS CHIDAKuda Bryan BwititiBwititi, who is the script writer and producer, told NewsDay yesterday that they were facing financial constraints to get the project off the ground. We started production of the film in 2016, but faced difficulties in financing the production which made us apply for crowd funding from a Netherlands organisation and the application was approved, he said. We are also aiming to get support from other organisations and corporates as well as the international community. Bwititi said they have also joined hands with other partners in the film industry to kick-start their campaign and their first target will be the communities they will be filming in. We are going to conduct a cleaning campaign in the communities that we are going to be filming, to raise awareness and establish relationships with locals, he said. We will encourage the cast and crew to use word of mouth to hype the campaign, our target for the first 30 days is 30% in which we are targeting our inner circles. Overspill is a social commentary on how the neglecting of duties by the civic society, the government and religious groups can directly influence the decisions young African Zimbabwean girls make.Bwititi said their aim is to highlight and raise awareness on the issues of child prostitution and sex slavery.
