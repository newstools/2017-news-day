Reports that top Zanu PF bigwigs closed Mutare at the weekend flaunting their ill-gotten wealth driving top-of-the-range all-terrain vehicles amid a sea of poverty are a clear indication that the ruling party does not care about the mess they have created for the majority. Comment: NewsDay EditorNo doubt if anyone ever had a doubt that the Zanu PF-led regime has long lost interest in the welfare of ordinary Zimbabweans, perhaps they need to revisit their thrust.It is ironic that all this happened in the Eastern Highlands the crux of the country s diamond wealth from which every citizen should rightly benefit but, alas, neither the country has benefited. Last Saturday the top Zanu PF chefs were eager to outdo each other showing they are swimming in wealth, while the citizens can barely scrap for a living.Zimbabweans would remember President Robert Mugabe s disclosure that the country had lost $15 billion in diamond revenue, and any right-thinking citizen would not look any further than the ill-gotten wealth the top party officials have amassed by being associated with Zanu PF.It boggles the mind how party bosses could parade their top-of-the-range all-terrain vehicles amid poverty-stricken citizens, mostly vendors, who were awestruck by the procession which criss-crossed the city as the party gurus prepared for Mugabe s rally on Friday.Clearly, the painful truth should have been clear to all those who witnessed it, and psyche them up on how to take their destiny into their own hands when 2018 comes because, like one wise man once said: Zimbabweans have the leadership that they deserve.It s clear that the powers-that-be are not concerned whatsoever about the poverty afflicting the majority of the citizens.The fact that these bigwigs could recklessly invade the pitch at Sakubva Stadium with just seven minutes to the kick-off of a match between former Premiership side Buffaloes and Tenax, delaying the match by almost 20 minutes, demonstrates the selfishness of our politicians. They do not care whatsoever about the citizens of this country. It is just about them.Sadly, the delegation included Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa, Provincial Affairs minister Mandiitawepi Chimene, Information minister Christopher Mushohwe and Energy minister Samuel Undenge. Did these fat cats, who are part of Mugabe s government, take time to find out from the people how they feel about the way their country is being governed and the hardships they have been forced to endure by Zanu PF? But as long as they are enjoying the wealth and comforts that their positions afford them, it is okay.We really need a leadership that cares and is moved by the suffering of the ordinary people, but this doesn t seem to be forthcoming from the Zanu PF leadership which regards power as an end in itself rather than a means to an end improving the lot of the ordinary people.
