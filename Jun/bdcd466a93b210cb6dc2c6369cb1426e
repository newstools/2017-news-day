Continuous development of human resource standards is essential in growing the economy, the Standards Association of Zimbabwe (SAZ) has said. BY TINOTENDA MUNYUKWISAZ director-general Eve GadzikwaThis came out during the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between SAZ and the Institute of People Management of Zimbabwe (IPMZ) in the capital yesterday.The MoU seeks to create a partnership between the two organisations in which they will work towards strengthening human resource standards in fulfilment of the ZimAsset objective of human capital development.Speaking to NewsDay on the sidelines of the signing ceremony, SAZ director-general, Eve Gadzikwa said, while the country is driving efforts towards building talent across various sectors, there was need to pay special attention to human resource standards which consequently have ripple effects on the final product produced, particularly by manufacturers. Zimbabwe right now is at an important stage in which it is focusing on building talent, and there is need for us to have HR [human resources] standards. Human capital is the most important asset in any of our companies if they are to become more productive and help grow the economy, she said.Last week, SAZ inked another MoU with ZimTrade in which both organisations will work towards capacitating local manufacturers in producing quality export goods for the international market and the MoU with IPMZ is another leap towards growing the Zimbabwean export market.Gadzikwa said: If we are promoting excellence in the human capital domain, our companies will certainly produce quality goods and this will go a long way in strengthening the capacity of organisations to export their products. So we are working with IPMZ to produce these HR standards which are in line with the International Organisation for Standardisation. IPMZ executive director Fortunate Sekeso emphasised on the need to ensure best practices among human resource practitioners that would have a positive impact on the country s businesses. The HR profession needs standards just like any other profession, to ensure best practices among HR professionals and also increase its impact on the nation s businesses, she said.
