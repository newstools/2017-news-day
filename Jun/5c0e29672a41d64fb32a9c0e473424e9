THE deepening suspicions between opposition parties gunning for a coalition to fight the Zanu PF behemoth in the 2018 election are likely to pose a threat to the envisaged unity. Comment: NewsDay EditorWith the MDC-T increasingly worried about what they claim to be National People s Party leader Joice Mujuru s disregard of their leader Morgan Tsvangirai, the possibilities of a strong coalition are becoming increasingly dim.The possibility, and envisaged success, of this coalition has provided hope to hard-pressed and frustrated Zimbabweans that finally there could be a strong united opposition to bring down Zanu PF and usher in a new dispensation in Zimbabwe after many years of corruption, economic mismanagement and political failure. Next year s elections are almost in sight and the coming together of opposition forces is perhaps the only hope that Zimbabweans have for a new leadership and prospects for a brighter future.The unity itself has been hailed as a momentous development for Zimbabwe. This is why it is worrisome that there could be some fragility in the coalition, with some MDC-T members not fully convinced of Mujuru s commitment as they accuse her of undermining Tsvangirai, who commands the largest opposition party in the country and nearly swept into power in the 2008 elections.Given the threat that Zanu PF still poses, it s important for opposition leaders to set aside their egos and focus on their common goal of removing President Robert Mugabe and Zanu PF from power to make way for a new day in Zimbabwe. It would be sad if the coalition collapses. That would be several steps backwards. Selfishness will be costly in this kind of an undertaking. Therefore, we urge all the parties in the coalition talks to respect each other and appreciate that every member is bringing something to the table.It is obvious that this kind of coalition of opposition parties across the divide presents the best chance to unseat Mugabe, but if political egos are allowed to get into the way, then it will be doomed from the very beginning.
