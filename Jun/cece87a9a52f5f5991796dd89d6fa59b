BY BUSINESS REPORTER Carol WhiteMeikles Hospitality operates the five-star Meikles Hotel and runs the Victoria Falls Hotel in partnership with African Sun Limited.Meikles Limited chairman John Moxon said the historic appointment of White was complemented by the group s delight in promoting a personality who was first involved with Meikles Hotel for 20 years. She re-joined the hospitality group 18 months ago. We take great pleasure in this appointment and we know White will lead the Meikles Hospitality team well as they reach out for increased levels of leisure and business travellers, as well as for increased levels of business in areas such as food and beverage, banqueting and conferencing, in the coming months and years, he said. It is our belief that the enormous potential of Zimbabwe s business and travel and tourism sector can and will be realised within the next few years and White will lead the team in taking advantage of opportunities that will flow from this development. Born and educated in Bulawayo, White has extensive career experience in travel and tourism, as well as in the freight and delivery sector.She spent 15 years in hospitality in Harare, at Sheraton Harare, Meikles Hotel and the Rainbow Tourism Group.In 2000, she moved to DHL Zimbabwe in a career switch, starting as commercial manager for Central Africa and then general manager for DHL Zimbabwe before being transferred to DHL Zambia, where she became managing director in 2006.She returned to Zimbabwe in 2016, taking up the position of sales director at Meikles Hospitality.White said she was honoured to lead this remarkable and stimulating team and to be involved with two of the best-known names in hospitality and tourism in Africa: Meikles Hotel and The Victoria Falls Hotel . Our task is to maximise and leverage levels of business and position these hotels in a highly competitive landscape. Victoria Falls is now a hub and not an extension to itineraries in South Africa, with the advent of new airlines flying directly from Addis Ababa and Nairobi and this is a game changer, she said. We shall work positively and in a forthright manner with all stakeholders and partners in the achievement of the goals, which will benefit not only our own business and the travel and tourism sector as a whole, but also the national economy in general.
