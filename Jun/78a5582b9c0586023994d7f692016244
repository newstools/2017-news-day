Log leaders Ngezi Platinum Stars title credentials will be put to further test tomorrow night when they visit Harare giants Dynamos in a potentially explosive Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at the National Sports Stadium. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKAKick-off time is 7pm.Tonderai Ndiraya s men have had a storming start to the campaign putting together eight wins, two draws and two defeats, which has seen them leap to the summit of the league with 26 points from 12 matches.That good run has forced all contenders to stand and take notice as the league marathon staggers towards the halfway mark.As they make the trip to Harare, Ndiraya s men are overflowing with confidence and looking to upset the Harare giants, and victory will dispel any doubts about their potential in the championship race.This is particularly so as Dynamos have hit a purple patch recently, winning all their last three matches against Harare City, ZPC Kariba and Tsholotsho.The Glamour Boys, six points off the pace, have won six, drawn two and lost three in the 11 matches they have played thus far.And Ndiraya, a former Dynamos player and coach, acknowledged it would not be an easy task get maximum points against his previous club. We are playing a big institution. They (Dynamos) have hit a purple patch and we are wary about them. We know what they are capable of doing. They are full of confidence and it will not be easy for us. But it s a job that has to be done so we have to prepare fully for the big battle. We are confident though of getting a good result, Ndiraya said.Ngezi Platinum go into the match severely handicapped as they are likely to be without some of their key players like Donald Teguru and Edgar Tapera after they picked injuries in their last league match against Chapungu, but could welcome back Walter Mukanga, who missed the last match because of injury.Dynamos too will be hoping to field a full-strength squad with several of their key players having missed the last trip to Tsholotsho owing to injuries. Cameroonian international Christian Ntouba did not travel to Beitbridge, but featured in the team s friendly match against Yadah on Friday.Gift Saunyama and Masimba Mambare have all been nursing injuries and the international break enabled them to recuperate ahead of tomorrow s clash.Castle Lager Premier Soccer League matchday 13/14 fixtures Today: Chapungu v Bulawayo City (Ascot), Chicken Inn v ZPC Kariba (Luveve), FC Platinum v Harare City (Mandava), Black Rhinos v Highlanders (Morris Depot), Triangle v Shabanie Mine (Gibbo)Tomorrow: Bantu Rovers v Tsholotsho (Luveve, 1pm), How Mine v Yadah FC (Luveve), Dynamos v Ngezi Platinum Stars (National Sports Stadium, 7pm), Hwange v Caps United (postponed)Saturday: ZPC Kariba v FC Platinum (Nyamhunga), Tsholotsho v Chicken Inn (Dulivhadzimo)Sunday: Harare City v Triangle (National Sports Stadium), Ngezi Platinum v Bantu Rovers (Baobab), Chapungu v Dynamos (Ascot), Highlanders v Hwange (Barbourfields), Bulawayo City v Yadah (Luveve), Shabanie Mine v Black Rhinos (Maglas), Caps United v How Mine (postponed)</strong>
