MUSICIAN and dancer Sandra Sandy Ndebele, who is tipped to dance away with at least one award at the inaugural Bulawayo Arts Awards set for Friday, has dropped an enthralling music video for the song, Tshibilika. BY SINDISO DUBESandra Sandy Ndebele and Leeknotic The video comes two months after the release of Ingoma as Sandy refuses to fade into oblivion with the passage of time.She was nominated for Outstanding Alternative Music, Song of the Year (for Ingoma) and Outstanding Female Artiste of the Year categories.The audio of the latest video, directed by Andy Cutta, was launched on Skyz Metro Vuka Vuka breakfast show before the video was made public via YouTube. Tshibilika is a dance song about bringing friends together for a good time and is accompanied by well-choreographed dance routines. This is my second single and video this year. It will be on the same album as Ingoma. I think this video will compliment Ingoma. It s a good follow-up in the right direction. This is just the beginning of greater things we have lined up for this year. It s all about good vibes and energy this year, Sandy said. Tshibilika was produced by Leroy Leeknotic Mhike, an Afro-house musician and producer signed under Afro Platinum Music, and Skaiva. Working with her [Sandy] was a milestone for me. I thank my management team for presenting me with the opportunity of working with her and I also thank her for joining hands with me, Leeknotic said. We fused two different sounds to create a good track. Tshibilika also presented me with a chance of working with Andy Cutta, who is a highly-skilled.
