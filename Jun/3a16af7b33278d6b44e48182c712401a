The opposition, led by MDC-T, recently raised alarm over the awarding of the biometric voter registration (BVR) tender to a Chinese company, raising fears that elections would be manipulated come 2018. Comment: NewsDay EditorFollowing the noise over Nikuv s alleged role in the last election, the electorate was bound to sit up and look once MDC-T raised the fears that the next elections were likely to be rigged.Now, party leader, Morgan Tsvangirai has come out to back the Chinese firm and allay fears of vote rigging, which can be confusing for prospective voters.For starters, what we have always asked from Zanu PF is clarity on policies, as it is always confusing when one official says one thing and someone else says another.It seems the bug has also bitten the opposition, as we have heard MDC-T secretary-general, Douglas Mwonzora and spokesman, Obert Gutu say one thing with Tsvangirai saying another.This does not inspire confidence in voters, particularly first-timers, who should be wooed vigorously.What they see is an opposition that cannot make up its mind and this will not encourage them to register let alone to vote.The deferential in this election will be youth and first-time voters and to get this group, the opposition has to get its messaging spot-on.If MDC-T think Laxton Group can be trusted, then they should say so with one voice rather than contradict each other at the very first turn.Tsvangirai also says Laxton Group can be trusted because it has carried out similar activities in other African countries, but so have Nikuv, yet MDC-T blames the Israeli company for its drubbing in the last election.We are at a very crucial stage ahead of the elections and there is need for consistency from opposition parties, as this will differentiate it from Zanu PF.The voter registration exercise starts anew this year, meaning the opposition has its work cut out for it in getting both new and old voters to register.This entails that they be honest and consistent in their messaging, with absolutely no room for vacillating.If the opposition have faith in Laxton Group, they ought to make sure of this, as there will be no room for them to turn around after the next election and blame the company for their loss.Crying out after elections is a sign of bad losers.Tsvangirai should know that once he has endorsed the Laxton Group, there can be no going back and he cannot be blaming them after elections.
