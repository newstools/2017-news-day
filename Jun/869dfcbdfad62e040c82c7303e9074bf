DYNAMOS and Chapungu have been made to wait longer for the outcome of their abandoned match after the Premier Soccer League (PSL) yesterday said they are still scrutinising the match officials reports from the game. BY henry mharaPSL had initially promised to release the verdict on the match yesterday after getting the match officials&#8217; reports, but instead released a statement saying they need more time to peruse the documents. This serves to advise that we have received the official match reports from the match commissioner and referee as well as the home team for the abandoned Castle Lager PSL match between Chapungu and Dynamos played at Ascot on Sunday 18 June, 2017. We are currently perusing the said reports and conducting internal consultations. Thereafter, we will advise all our stakeholders on the way forward, PSL said in a statement.The match was stopped on the 56th minute when a goalpost fell with Dynamos leading 4-0 courtesy of goals by Emmanuel Mandiranga (brace), Denver Mukamba and Christian Ntouba. Chapungu, who were the home side, tried in vain to fix the post, forcing the day s referee Martin Chivandire to call off the match.
