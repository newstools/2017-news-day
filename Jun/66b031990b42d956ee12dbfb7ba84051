A FORMER human resources officer at the late former army commander Vitalis Zvinavashe s private school, Tynwald, appeared at the Harare Magistrates Court yesterday facing fraud allegations after he allegedly pocketed $16 000 reserved as retrenchment packages for six ex-employees. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEThe accused, Simbarashe Zisengwe, who was managing staff members welfare at the school, was remanded in custody to today for bail ruling by magistrate Rumbidzai Mugwagwa.The school is represented by its headmaster, Sevious Mujere.Allegations are that sometime in 2015, the school retrenched six employees Edna and Nicholus Madzinga, Peter Matseyengwa, Gibson Hwititi, Taffty Kubera and Rabisack Dzinotyiwei.The former employees were entitled to terminal benefits that were calculated as payment in lieu of leave and pension from Old Mutual.It is alleged Zisengwe was in charge of processing their terminal benefits paid out by the school and pension fund run by Old Mutual.In April 2015, when Madziva s contract was terminated, Zisengwe, on two different occasions, allegedly signed for $4 000 and $1 000 on school vouchers for the purposes of depositing it into Madziva s bank account, but converted the money to his own use.As a result, the complainant suffered a prejudice of $5 000 and nothing was recovered.Using the same modus operandi, Zisengwe allegedly claimed there was a tax shortfall and deducted $571 from Matseyengwa s benefits and converted the money to his own use.He also allegedly pocketed $3 014, which was supposed to be paid to Madzinga and another $2 144, which was due to be paid to Zimbabwe Educational, Scientific, Social and Cultural Workers Union.He is also alleged to have pocketed $1 035, which was supposed to be paid to Hwititi among several other amounts.
