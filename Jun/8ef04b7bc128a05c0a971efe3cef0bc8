Mupfumira has since responded to the litigation, saying she is ready with her defence.In its declaration, Easy-Go (Pvt) Ltd said sometime between 2014 and 2015, it entered into an agreement with the Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare ministry, in terms of which the ministry hired vehicles for use by its officers from the firm.The firm further said after the agreement was signed, it went ahead and fulfilled its obligations by providing the car hiring services to the ministry, but the latter allegedly reneged to play its part, prompting the firm to approach the court for recourse. Defendant breached the agreement by paying part of the amount, leaving a balance in the sum of $132 297,07. Defendant is liable to pay the plaintiff the total sum, being the amount outstanding arising from car hire services which were rendered to the defendant by the plaintiff, the firm said.
