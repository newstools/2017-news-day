HOW MINE&#8230;&#8230; 0 HIGHLANDERS&#8230;.0HOW Mine s two-match winning streak came to an end after they were held by Highlanders in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match played at Barbourfields Stadium yesterday. BY FORTUNE MBELEThe gold miners, who came into the match on the back of a good run where they have won three and drew one, failed to convert the chances they created with the best falling to Timothy January in first half s optional time, but was denied by Highlanders goalkeeper Ariel Sibanda who made a brilliant save.After playing below par for the better part of the first half, the home side improved in the second stanza and could have scored six minutes after the break, but Tsepo Ranthokoane s speculative long-range shot from a free kick was punched away for a corner by an alert Sibanda.Ten minutes later, Toto Banda s header off a cross by Peter Moyo was off target as How Mine continued to bombard hapless Highlanders, who only picked up their game towards the end of the match.How Mine coach Kelvin Kaindu was disappointed by the result, but said a point was better than going home empty-handed. I think we have dropped points. We had the lion s share. Our opponents just played football in the last 10 minutes, but a point is better than nothing. It is unfortunate that we could get maximum points despite dominating the game, Kaindu said.With the draw How Mine are on sixth position with 25 points, the same number with Highlanders who are one rung above courtesy of a better goal difference.Highlanders fashioned the first chance of the game four minutes into play, but Erick Mudzingwa s header missed the upright.Ralph Matema was the closest the two sides came into scoring a goal when his header hit the upright on 78th minute for Highlanders and Simon Munawa was denied by goalkeeper Munyaradzi Diya from close range seven minutes later.Highlanders coach Erol Akbay in his post-match comments said: How Mine did not allow us to play our normal game and our strikers were not sharp on the chances that we got, Akbay said.TEAMSHOW MINE: M Diya, T Ranthokoane, M Ncube, K Chideu, F Makarati, M Sakala, T Banda, P Manhanga (T Makanda, 89&#8242;), P Moyo (B Banda, 83 ), K Musharu, T JanuaryHIGHLANDERS: A Sibanda, B Ncube, B Phiri, T Ndlovu, P Muduhwa, E Mudzingwa, R Matema, S Munawa, R Mutuma (G Makaruse, 46&#8242;), B Banda (G Nyoni, 75 ), A Gahadzikwa (K Nadolo, 63&#8242;)</strong>
