Auditor-General Mildred Chiri s latest report has opened a can of worms amid indications that State-owned mobile network operator NetOne executives were reluctant to recover over $11 million owed by Firstel Cellular despite the debt remaining on its debtors book for a long time. BY PAIDAMOYO MUZULUThe observation is contained in the AG s 2015 annual audit reports on parastatals and State-owned enterprises released last week.Chiri noted the parastatal was reluctant to follow up on $11 million owed to it by Firstel Cellular, a company in which some senior NetOne executives have shares in. Trade receivables balance included an amount of $11 413 991 which was due from Firstel, a company in which some senior executives of NetOne had interests in. Firstel was no longer operating and there was no evidence of efforts to recover this outstanding amount, Chiri said.She also noted that the mobile network operator had paid Bopela Group $3 405 314 in advance for installation of base stations, but service was not delivered in full despite the payment. The contract with Bopela Group, a company engaged to construct mobile telecommunications base stations was not availed for audit verification. There were outstanding works in respect of fencing of completed base stations, Chiri added.She noted that Bopela Group had received an advance payment of $3 405 314 from NetOne, but only did work valued at $2 032 338. This means Bopela Group received $524 440 for work it did not deliver.In the voluminous report, Chiri also noted that the Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara) had also overpaid a supplier to the tune of over $200 000 under unclear circumstances.The unnamed company was given a contract to carry out road resurfacing works at One Commando Regiment based at Cranborne Barracks and the Police General Headquarters. The total amount on the contract was $447 154 for the works done. I observed Zinara made payments amounting to $652 830 for the works done at One Commando and PGHQ, which were $205 667 above the contract price and some payments were made without supporting documents, Chiri noted.The report would be debated soon in Parliament after it was tabled with the ministers responsible for the parastatals answering questions from the committee of Parliament responsible for public accounts.
