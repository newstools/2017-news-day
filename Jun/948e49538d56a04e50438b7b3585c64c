MASVINGO Worship Choir is set to do a live recording of its debut 18-track DVD album at Charles Austin Theatre on July 1, almost a year after it was established. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKOMasvingo Worship ChoirChoir director Luke Manyamazi said recording live would make the album more appealing to music lovers. We are having an audio-visual production through live performance since that is more appealing to audiences than videos in mountains and rivers, he said, adding that the tracks would be recorded in two segments.The first segment will have worship songs while the second will have praise songs. Since the choir is a platform to promote the rich music talent in Masvingo, many members brought their own compositions, he said.Manyamazi was optimistic that the live recording would be successful. We were greatly inspired by Joyous Celebrations, Worship House and our own Zimpraise. Some groups in Masvingo tried it before, but never succeeded. We believe that we will make it and our success will definitely put the province on the map, he said. This weekend we will conduct a clean-up campaign in the Masvingo central business district to draw people to this memorable event. Entry tickets to witness the live recording scheduled to start at 1400 hours are pegged at $5 (VIP), $2 (adults) and $1 for children. The 20-member youthful interdenominational outfit draws its membership from different churches including Harvest House, ZAOGA, Apostolic Faith Mission, Glory Temple, Heartfelt Ministries and Reformed Church of Zimbabwe.
