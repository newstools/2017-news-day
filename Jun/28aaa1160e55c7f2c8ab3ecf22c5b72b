OVER 200 leading women editors and journalists are gathered at the Durban International Convention Centre for the inaugural Women in News (WIN) summit, whose thrust is to enhance efforts on increasing women s leadership and voices in the news. BY PHYLLIS MBANJE/VENERANDA LANGARunning under the theme Breaking Through, the summit is a joint collaboration between the World Media Congress and World Editors&#8217; Forum.Speaking at the official opening yesterday, the guest of honour, Cecil Julin, who is Sweden&#8217;s ambassador to South Africa, said it was time for women to take up their position and defy all odds, which include harassment and stifling of their potential.Sharing experiences from their newsrooms, women news leaders said they were still facing a lot of challenges.The chairperson of the South African Editors&#8217; Forum, Mahlatsi Gallens, said women constantly faced harassment based on their gender and even race.&#8220;Women fend off advances by politicians, and are often disregarded in the newsroom based on their age, she said.Gallens acknowledged the changes being effected and expressed hope these would translate into real progress. Former Mail and Guardian editor, Verashni Pillay, said female journalists were constantly shot down by their male collegues. Women in professional environments experience criticism from their male counterparts, she said Jumana Ghunaimat, editorial chief at Alghad, Jordan, said: What I can say to a woman is that we should have a vision, strategy and plan and we will survive. Presenting awards to outstanding women in the media, Julin emphasised the need for female journalists to support each other. These awards recognise excellence and integrity, but teamwork remains key, the Swedish ambassador said.Accepting her award for Editorial Leadership, the laureate for sub-Saharan Africa, Pamela Sittoni, who is the managing editor at the East African and international desk editor at the Nation Media Group, said women deserved more opportunities. Let us hold the leadership accountable, she said.
