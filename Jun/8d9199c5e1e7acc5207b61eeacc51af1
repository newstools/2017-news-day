Chapungu . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (0)1 Bulawayo CITY . . . . .. . . . . . . .0Chapungu s revival continued after they narrowly beat Bulawayo City yesterday at Ascot Stadium to secure their third win of the season, while stretching their unbeaten run in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League to seven matches. BY MUKUDZEI CHINGWEREVeteran striker, Philip Marufu scored the priceless goal in added time to secure all set of points for the hosts in an evenly-balanced affair, which had looked destined to end in a stalemate.Yesterday s result means the army side have now gone for seven games without conceding a goal.The visitors settled well in the match, but failed to create any clear cut chances to break the deadlock earlier in the match.Their first meaningful opportunity to break the stalemate came after the breather when Clive Rupiya intelligently shot to the left of a fully-stretched Talbert Shumba in goal for Chapungu, who pushed his effort wide for a corner.Marufu, however, had the most important contribution of the match, when he tapped in a long throw-in from Collen Kwaramba in added time to secure maximum points for the hosts.Winning coach, Tendai Chikuni was happy with the victory, saying he came into the game with one eye on the weekend game against Dynamos. Today we did not play our normal game, we wasted chances in the first half. But the good thing is that we managed to get maximum points. We rested other players today with a game against Dynamos in mind, he saidLosing coach Mandla Mpofu felt his charges were unlucky not to come out of the contest with at least a point. It is just unfortunate that we lost the game, that is how football is, it is cruel at times. We are not demoralised, though, we will work hard to improve especially with over last-minute concentration. Today, we played well, but unfortunately we go home empty-handed, Mpofu said.
