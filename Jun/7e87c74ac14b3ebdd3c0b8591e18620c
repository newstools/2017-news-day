AFTER slowly clambering up the log standings in recent weeks following a difficult start to the season, the true test of Dynamos revival will come tonight when they face off against joint pacesetters, Ngezi Platinum Stars in a potentially-explosive Castle Lager Premiership football tie at the National Sports Stadium. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKADynamos coach Lloyd MutasaDeMbare have hit a purple patch, winning their last three matches after a slow start to their campaign.The Glamour Boys, six points off the pace, have won six, drawn two and lost three in the 11 matches they have played so far.Their resurgence will, however, be put to the test against a Ngezi Platinum side, which is overflowing with confidence after a storming start to the campaign.Ndiraya s men have put together eight wins, two draws and two defeats, which has seen them earning 26 points from 12 matches.That good run has forced all contenders to stand and take notice, as the league marathon staggers towards the halfway mark.Victory over Dynamos will consolidate their place at the top of the log and dispel any doubts about their potential.Ngezi Platinum though, go into the match severely handicapped, as they are likely to be without some of their key players such as Donald Teguru and Edgar Tapera after they picked injuries in their last league match against Chapungu.Dynamos team manager, Richard Chihoro feels the presence of former Dynamos sons in the Ngezi Platinum camp will make it an emotional encounter.Ngezi Platinum are coached by Tonderai Ndiraya, a former Dynamos player and coach, while his assistant, Gift Muzadzi, left the Harare giants before the start of this season.The team also has on its books several former Dynamos players including captain Partson Jaure, Godknows Murwira, Dominic Mukandi, Walter Mukanga and Kelvin Bulaji. It will be a very difficult and emotional match against Ngezi Platinum. If you look at their team, it is dominated by former Dynamos players. The coach is also a Dynamos son, so basically it s Dynamos versus Dynamos. We anticipate a very tough match, Chihoro said.The Dynamos team manager, however, said the return from injury of some of their key players, such as Cameroonian international, Christian Ntouba, was a big boost for the team.Ntouba missed Dynamos last trip to Tsholotsho due to injury, with midfielder, Gift Saunyama and Masimba Mambare also having been on the treatment table.The trio has been recuperating during the international break and Dynamos are happy to welcome their players as they face the log leaders. They have all recovered and are available for selection. It gives the coaches options and we are looking forward to the game. They are the log leaders, but our ambition is to maintain our form, Chihoro said.Matchday 13 Results and Fixtures Yesterday: Chapungu 1-0 Bulawayo City, Chicken Inn 2-0 ZPC Kariba, FC Platinum 0-0 Harare City, Black Rhinos 3-0 Highlanders, Triangle 3-1 Shabanie Mine Today: Bantu Rovers v Tsholotsho (Luveve, 1pm), How Mine v Yadah FC (Luveve), Dynamos v Ngezi Platinum Stars (National Sports Stadium, 7pm), Hwange v CAPS United (postponed)</strong>
