BULAWAYO businessman Makomborero Chikomo recently lost over $39 800 in a suspected botched maize import deal involving two alleged fraudsters who mispresented that they could help him secure bulk maize supplies from South Africa for resale back home. BY SILAS NKALAThis was heard by Bulawayo magistrate Tinashe Tashaya when one of the suspects, Takunda Michael Mahati, appeared in court facing a fraud allegation. Mahati was granted $300 bail and remanded to July 4.The court heard that sometime in March 2017, Mahati (29) connived with Anthony Moses Banda, who is at large, and defrauded Chikomo of $39 810 after enticing him into a deal, where he would buy bulk maize quantities from a South African company, Broadcres, for resale in Zimbabwe.On March 28 this year, Mahati allegedly visited Chikomo s workplace and received $21 410 cash on the understanding that the balance would be paid within a week.On the same day, Chikomo checked on the purported proof of payment and realised that it reflected Julian Ncube as the supplier of the maize, instead of Broadcres.When he queried the anomaly, Banda allegedly assured him that it would be rectified.Two days later, Mahati went to Chikomo and collected the balance of $12 400 cash.Banda later called Chikomo and told him that he smelt a rat as Mahati was no longer answering his mobile phone. Chikomo then reported the matter to police.Mahati later met Banda and they allegedly shared the spoils before the former was arrested at his house in Glen Norah A, Harare.Police also discovered that Mahati had used part of the money to buy a VW Golf in Mussina and registered it in his name.Chikomo suffered an actual prejudice of $35 810 due to the fraud.
