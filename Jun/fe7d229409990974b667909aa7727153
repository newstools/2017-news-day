Moments later, he also missed a header from a corner kick.It was Kamusoko, instead, who came close, but his stunning free kick hit the underside of the cross bar on 41 minutes.Teenage Hadebe, who partnered Jaure in the heart of the defence, nearly committed treason, miscuing his effort in a desperate bid to clear the ball from danger.However, Russia-based, Sylvanus Nimely failed to punish the defender, slicing his effort wide of goal.Teams:Warriors: G Chigova, P Jaure, T Hadebe, E Chipeta, O Bhasera, D Phiri, T Kamusoko, M Nakamba, K Mahachi, (O Karuru, 87 ), T Ndoro, (E Rusike, 71 ) K Musona,Liberia: B Souza, Z Krangar (D Murray, 57 ), P Kennedy, H Varney, G Dirkir, T Dennis, S Nyumah, M Macauley, S Nimely, P Saydee, Mark Paye (C Jackson, 57 )</strong>
