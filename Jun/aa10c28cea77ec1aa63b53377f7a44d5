TWENTY college beauties are set to tussle for the crown during the Miss Mutare Polytechnic pageant finals scheduled for July 1 at the posh Golden Peacock Villa Hotel, where dancehall sensation, Killer T, will provide entertainment. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Killer TThe tertiary institution has been hosting the beauty pageant annually and it has grown in leaps and bounds with each passing year. One of the organisers, Tsitsi Kunzwa, told NewsDay yesterday that preparations for the show were nearly complete. Preparations for the Miss Polytechnic are at an advanced stage. We would like to thank Golden Peacock for providing us with the venue. It s an excellent venue. There will be buses that will ferry people from Mutare Polytechnic to the hotel where we will be hosting the event, she said.She said they opted for Killer T to provide entertainment after several considerations. We had a tough time in trying to select the artiste to entertain revellers during our Miss Polytechnic, but we have since settled for Killer T. He is a good musician who is going to deliver on the night, she said.The hotel s entertainment manager, Willard Widzo Madhombiro, said they were ready to host the event. Our venue is always ready to host such events and we are encouraging people around the province or countrywide to come and witness this glamorous event. Last year we successfully hosted the event, but this year we are expecting the event to grow much bigger, he said.
