AN Indian businesswoman, Nighert Parween Savania, has taken the Registrar of Deeds, Master of the High Court and a businessman, Nathan Mnaba, to court seeking placement of a caveat on Norwich Trading (Pvt) Ltd pending finalisation of an ownership wrangle. BY CHARLES LAITONSavania filed the court application on Tuesday this week accusing Mnaba of having advertised the company as being on sale despite the unresolved ownership wrangle between the parties.In the court papers, Savania said she sold Norwich Trading to Mnaba for $380 000, who allegedly only paid $250 000 and reneged on payment of the remaining $130 000, leading to the cancellation of the agreement.The businesswoman also said she had since reported the matter to the police and Mnaba was currently facing criminal charges at the Harare Magistrates Court regarding the alleged fraudulent transfer of the firm into his name. Pursuant to the criminal trial at Regional Magistrates Court, the first respondent (Mnaba) is seeking and intends to dispose the immovable property, being a certain piece of land situate in the District of Salisbury called Stand 750 Greystone Park Township held under deed of transfer 11896/98 and it came to my attention upon perusal of classifieds on the internet that the property is being advertised for sale, Savania said through her lawyers, Kachere Legal Practitioners. It is my humble view that the action of the first respondent is to fraudulently dispose the property to my prejudice and detriment. In the premises, I seek to place a caveat on the deed of transfer to stay any transfer or sale to a third party and to prohibit the first respondent from fraudulently disposing the property pending the finalisation of the civil matter before this honourable court in connection with this property in question and finalisation of a criminal matter in the Regional Magistrates Court. She added: The respondent is reneging, expressing an intention to dispose of the property and denying his obligations in terms of the agreement, which I cancelled and seek confirmation by this honourable court, hence in light of this need for legal redress to place a caveat in respect of the immovable property on the deed of transfer. The matter is yet to be set down for hearing.
