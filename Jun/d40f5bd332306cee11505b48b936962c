The Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) Company is on the offensive to lure exhibitors for this year s Mining, Engineering and Transport Expo (Mine Entra) amid declining exhibitor numbers over the years. BY BUSINESS REPORTER This year s edition of Mine Entra will be held in Bulawayo from July 19 to 21 under the theme, Exploring Linkages in the Mining Value Chain.ZITF Company board chairperson, Ruth Ncube, told guests at a stakeholders luncheon that exhibitors numbers had gone down to 119 last year from 218 in 2014. In 2015, the expo attracted 172 exhibitors. This is telling a story that we must do something. Space occupied has declined by 50%. We are not happy, we know this is the only game in town and we are saying where are you? In his interventions at the luncheon, Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries president, Sifelani Jabangwe, said the bulk of exhibitors should be service providers in the sector. If there are strong linkages, the players would come to the exhibition. Those that are coming are the ones getting business, he said.In response, Ncube said the Mine Entra was supposed to be handled by the mining industry and her company was providing space to have linkages discussed and action plans taken. We want you to lead this exhibition. Come 2018, this exhibition is coming to your hands, it not our business, Ncube said.
