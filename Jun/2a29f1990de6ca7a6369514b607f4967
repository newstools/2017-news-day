SABLES coach Cyprian Mandenge has named all the experienced players in his depleted squad in the starting line up in the hope of securing a winning start in the opening Rugby Africa God Cup encounter against Senegal today. BY DANIEL NHAKANISOThe national senior rugby side is desperate to get off to a strong start in Dakar in their attempt to reassert their dominance on the continent ahead of next year s qualifiers for the 2019 Rugby World Cup to be held in Japan.Mandenge, however, has to do with a severely-depleted side as key players who had become very much part of the Sables in recent fixtures, are all not available due to a combination of financial constraints, injuries and other commitments.The forwards department appears to be the hardest hit with the likes of former captain Jacques Leitao, prop Farai Mudariki, center Riaan O Neil, number eight Kingsley Lang and flanks Andrew Rose and Njabulo Ncube all missing.Captain Denford Mutamangira will lead the side from the front row where he is joined by hooker Tolerance Zishe and tighthead Lawrence Cleminson while veteran Fortune Chipendu and Witness Mandizha make up the second row.Flankers Biselele Tshamala and Australia-based Connor Pritchard complete a new look loose trio with Harare Sports Club eighthman Osbourne Muhambi.While the lack of experience in the forwards pack is a cause of great concern for the Sables technical bench, the backline also appear vulnerable due to a few positional changes.Zimbabwe s halfback department, boosted by the presence of playmaker and kicker, flyhalf Tichafara Makwanya, can also rely on the experience of scrumhalves Farai Mudariki and Scotty Jones for vital linkage.In the absence of the injured O Neil, the Sables technical department has been forced to take a gamble by selecting an untested centre pairing comprising of the uncapped duo of second-choice flyhalf Lenience Tambwera and Ngoni Chibuwe.The match kicks off at 1730 hours (Zimbabwean time) at the Iba Mar Diop Stadium in Dakar.Sables starting line-up(1-15): D Mutamangira, T Zishe, L Cleminson, F Chipendu, W Mandizha, C Pritchard, B Tshamala, O Muhambi, H Mudariki, T Makwanya, S Hunduza, L Tambwera, N Chibuwe, T Kumadiro, Tadius DzandiwandiraReplacements (16-23): T Bvunzawabaya, G Cochrane, I Nduwa, B Nyaude, T Mandiwanza, S Jones, T Gwisai, T Mugariri</strong>
