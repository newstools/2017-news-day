THE Mashonaland Senior Golf Association will host the 85th edition of the Senior Golfers Society of Zimbabwe (SGSZ) national tournament which tees off at Brooke Golf Club (formerly Borrowdale Brooke) today and runs through to Sunday. BY DANIEL NHAKANISOMike Ives, the Mashonaland Senior Golfers Society captain, said they were expecting a big field of 90 golfers drawn from around the country s provinces and neighbouring Zambia. On behalf of Mashonaland Senior Golfers Society, I would like to welcome all the players who will be participating in this year s tournament. We have a very good field of over 90 participants with representatives coming from Zambia, Lowveld, Manicaland, Midlands and Mashonaland. Special thanks must go to those from outside Harare who have braved many roadblocks here. Our nationals committee has worked tirelessly in these trying times to organise this tournament. Ives thanked their sponsors for their support towards the hosting of this year s tournament. The tournament has been made possible by the generosity of many donors and sponsors. We are grateful to our sponsors because without them, hosting a tournament of this magnitude would not be possible. As usual, the course is in pristine condition this year and we hope we will have an enjoyable three days of golf, he said.The SGSZ, which is open to golfers over the age of 55, has a very rich history in Zimbabwe dating back to January 30, 1936 when an inaugural meeting was held in Bulawayo where it was resolved that a Senior Golfers Society of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) be formed.Playing members are required to play in at least six official games in a calendar year.
