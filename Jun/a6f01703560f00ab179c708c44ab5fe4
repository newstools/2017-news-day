Small-to-Medium enterprises (SMEs), involved in the manufacturing of goods, have been warned against the disposal of residue material into the environment that might pose a health risk to communities in which they operate in. By Munesu Nyakudya/ Tinotenda MunyukwiThis came out during a tour of a rising small-to-medium paper packaging enterprise, K Davie Packaging, by various stakeholders, who included government officials and the Affirmative Action Group yesterday.The company s managing director, Kudzanayi Dave, who is also Zimbabwe s Business Woman of the Year for 2016, said as a small enterprise, they were recycling products that they made as a way of preserving the environment in which they are operating within. We take the recycling route because we need to be cautious of the environment we operate in, to preserve it and make sure what we are doing does not at all damage it in any way, she said.The company supplies packaging material to big organisations, among them Dairibord Zimbabwe and Cairns Foods.Dave urged other SMEs to emulate her, starting with best practices in environmental preservation. Others in the SMEs manufacturing sector must shun ill disposal of residue material and preserve not just the inside environment that they are operating in, but also the outside environment, because we need to show that we are doing our business responsibly in order to get all the support that we need, she added.Ityai Frank Kurebwa, who is a director in the Psychomotor ministry, said the government was pursuing the issue of land for SMEs to ensure that they have a permanent place of their own, which is bigger and convenient.Residents in urban areas have clashed with SMEs over some of their activities, which were detrimental to the environment.Fence manufacturers have been accused of burning tyres at night in Harare s Willowvale area in order to extract wires for fence-making.Zimbabwe adopted a National Occupational Safety and Health Policy in 2014, which stipulates how manufacturers are mandated to ply their trade responsibly, while preserving the environment.
