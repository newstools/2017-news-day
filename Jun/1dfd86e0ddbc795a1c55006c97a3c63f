BULAWAYO street vendors have accused the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) of invading and selling cabbages at their vending sites. BY MTHANDAZO NYONIIn a statement yesterday, Bulawayo Vendors and Traders Association (BVTA) said the prison authorities had no right to invade their selling points and start trading without authority from the city council. BVTA feels that this is short-changing vendors and informal traders who pay for their licences to the local authority, read part of the statement. BVTA acknowledges economic hardships faced by everyone in the country where citizens have turned into vending as a source of livelihood. However, that is not the ticket to abuse Bulawayo City Council by-laws and have unfair advantage over vendors and informal traders who are paying for their vending licences, BVTA said.But, ZPCS Matabeleland North spokesperson Bothwell Bhosha professed ignorance over the matter. We have not received a formal complaint from either vendors or Bulawayo City Council officials, he said.
