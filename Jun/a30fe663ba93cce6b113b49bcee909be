CHITUNGWIZA Municipality will lay off 300 workers, as it struggles to balance its wage bill and improve service delivery in the sprawling dormitory town, which is being administered by a three-member commission after mayor, Phillip Mutoti and his councillors were suspended on corruption charges. BY PAIDAMOYO MUZULUThe council s restructuring exercise has been given impetus by the Madzudzo Pawadyira-led commission that recently started a human resource skills and qualifications audit.A senior council official confirmed the development. The council is revisiting its organogram and the work that has to be done. At the end of the exercise, we should have 856 workers from the current staff establishment of 1 132, the official said.Pawadyira s commission has established that many of the council s employee s do not have the requisite minimum five Ordinary Level subject passes.The official added the council would also reduce the staff in the works department and rely more on casual labour. Council now will have to depend on casual labour for some jobs like roads and this process is meant to manage the precarious financial position of the municipality, the official said.Chitungwiza town clerk, George Makunde was diplomatic when asked contacted for comment. The restructuring programme is work in progress and still continuing. The process would be handled in a manner that would allow us to be able to pay the severances packages of those affected, he said.Pressed further on the issue, Makunde said: We have to have a single channel of releasing information, particularly that the council is now under the administration of a commission. The commission chairperson should be speaking on many of the issues. Chitungwiza has, over the years, been battling to fund salaries and wages, as its staff compliment skyrocketed to 2 439 at its peak, as workers were engaged on patronage basis.Elected councillors have, in the past, recommended the hiring of people from the wards after each poll without regard for council s financial position.
