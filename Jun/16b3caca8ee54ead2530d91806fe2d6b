AS the Warriors bask in the glow of their comprehensive victory over Liberia in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) opening Group G football qualifier at the National Sports Stadium on Sunday, defensive midfielder Danny Deco Phiri, in an assessment of their performance, believes the ultimate measure of the Warriors credentials is how they will fare against the two other group members Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Congo Brazzaville. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKADanny PhiriThe Warriors, playing their first competitive match since Norman Mapeza was appointed interim coach, delivered a super show to demolish Liberia 3-0, courtesy of Knowledge Musona s superb hat-trick.However, Deco reckons while they deserved to bask in the glory of that victory, the real test would be against DRC former champions and perennial features at the continental football showcase. Congo Brazzaville has also won the tournament before. This is a very good start for us in this campaign. It was a very good performance by the team. But we now need to work even harder because tougher games are coming. DRC is one of the teams that pose a real threat. They are a better and more experienced side than Liberia and we need to prepare thoroughly for them. Congo Brazzaville are also a very good side and it will be a different game altogether, Phiri, one of the survivors from the squad that did duty in Gabon, said.After a lacklustre show at the 2017 Afcon finals in Gabon, where they managed just a draw against Algeria, it was perhaps refreshing to see a new-look side stringing several passes in a display rarely seen on these shores.They might have been playing against one of the lowest-ranked teams, but Mapeza s men, featuring a host of new faces who were not part of those that qualified for Gabon, showed a lot of potential to go all the way in their bid to make it to the next Afcon finals to be hosted by Cameroon.With DRC overcoming Congo Brazzaville 3-1 earlier on Saturday, the victory over the Lone Stars lifted the Warriors to the summit of the group.Musona, who was handed the armband to lead the team last week, taking over from Willard Katsande, who was not considered by Mapeza, scored his first hat-trick for the Warriors as Liberia, beaten with an identical scoreline here seven years ago, could do little to resist the firepower.DRC, who were knocked out at the quarter-final stage at the Gabon tournament in January, remain the group favourite to go through and Phiri reckons that getting points against them would give the Warriors a good chance.DRC boast of an array of talent with all their players playing at the highest level across Europe.Some of the big names in their squad include Cedrick Bakambu, who plays for Spanish giants Villarreal, and the forward scored a brace against Congo Brazzaville on Saturday, Everton s Yannick Bolasie, Dieumerci Mbokani of Hull City, Benik Afobe of Bournemouth, Gael Kakuta of Deportivo de La Coru a, Arthur Masuaku of West Ham and their star of the 2017 Afcon finals in Gabon, Junior Kabananga, who plays for FC AstanaZimbabwe s next 2019 Afcon match is away to Congo Brazzaville at the Stade Alphonse Massamba-Debat on March 27 next year.They will then face DRC away on September 3 and will host the same opponents a week later.They travel to Liberia on October 16 before concluding their campaign with a home game against Congo-Brazzaville on November 13.
