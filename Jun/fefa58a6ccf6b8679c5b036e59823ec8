CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League champions Caps United host Bantu Rovers in a re-arranged showdown at the National Sports Stadium this evening hoping to collect maximum points having garnered just 10 from the seven matches they have played in the campaign. By Sports ReporterThe Green Machine, representing Zimbabwe in the prestigious Caf Champions League, have a lot of some catch-up to do in the championship as they have still to play five more games to be at par with other teams.After winning two matches, drawing four and losing one against ZPC Kariba, the Green Machine are aware that victory over struggling Bantu Rovers will keep them within the chasing pack.With an upcoming African Champions League trip to Tunisia next week for a clash against Al Ahly Tripoli of Libya, who are playing their home matches in Tunis owing to violence in their country, a victory will be a morale booster ahead of that assignment.Lloyd Chitembwe however, is likely to rest some of the regulars for the match against Bantu Rovers as he prepares for the match away in Tunis.The Green Machine already have several key players who are nursing injuries including Hardlife Zvirekwi, goalkeeper Edmore Sibanda, defender Dennis Dauda and Tafadzwa Rusike.Sibanda and Dauda, who had been called up to the Warriors, were excluded from the squad at the eleventh hour due to injuries. Although they are unlikely to play a part tonight, they are expected to be part of the travelling squad to Tunisia.Bantu Rovers, second from the bottom with just six points from 11 matches, are winless in their last four matches and will be seeking to upset the champions.
