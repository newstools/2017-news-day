HIGHLANDERS have set up a three-man disciplinary committee within the Premiership football club s membership to hear the cases of suspended assistant coach Amini Soma-Phiri and goalkeepers coach Cosmas Zulu. BY FORTUNE MBELEElroy AkbayThe committee is chaired by city lawyer Zibusiso Ncube, who will preside over the cases together with former club secretary-general Andrew Tapela and club member Innocent Batsani Ncube.Bosso chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube yesterday described the three as having a wealth of experience regarding such issues.Ncube is a former a Zifa Southern Region disciplinary committee member, bringing in the legal expertise, while Batsani is experienced in corporate processes and Tapela is a former football administrator who has previously served in the Highlanders executive committee. These are level-headed people who have a wealth of experience and what we wait for now is for them to come up with a date for the hearing, which will probably be any time this week, Dube said.Soma-Phiri and Zulu were suspended on June 16 for indiscipline after they allegedly insulted each other in front of players on their way from Mandava after the abandoned league match against FC Platinum on May 28.They also allegedly had another spat in Harare on June 14 during the match against Black Rhinos, which Highlanders lost 3-0.Highlanders CEO Dube indicated that the club s leadership would be guided by recommendations of the disciplinary committee in determining the future of the suspended coaches.Head coach Erol Akbay has been assisted by Division One developmental side coach Melusi Sibanda at training.However, Sibanda is not eligible to sit on the bench and Akbay was in sole charge in the 3-0 win over Hwange and the goalless draw against How Mine at Barbourfields Stadium.Soma-Phiri and Zulu have since submitted reports to the Highlanders executive committee after they were handed their suspension letters.
