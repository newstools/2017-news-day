A 28-YEAR-OLD Nyazura man, Munyaradzi Chanakira, yesterday appeared at the Harare Magistrates Court facing fraud allegations after attempting to swindle airtime worth $170 from a Rusape vendor by misrepresenting that he was a recruiting officer within the Central Intelligence Office. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEChanakira was granted $50 by Harare magistrate Barbara Chimboza, who remanded him to July 13 pending finalisation of investigations.The complainant in the matter, Douglas Makiwa, is Chanakira s former student at Theresa Mission in Rusape. It is the State case that sometime in 2013, Chanakira approached Makiwa and misrepresented to him that he could secure employment for him in the President s office.It is alleged Makiwa expressed willingness to join the spooks and Chanakira advised him to submit his application together with academic certificates after which he further promised to update him on the results. In February 2014, it is alleged Chanakira phoned Makiwa and advised him to attend an interview in Harare following an application he had made. But Makiwa indicated he was not able to attend because he was committed elsewhere.The State alleges on February 8 this year, Chanakira again phoned Makiwa and advised him that since he had failed to attend a previous interview, he wanted to book him for another interview at branch 5 in Harare.It is alleged he then ordered him to bring $170 for vetting at one Gwati s office at the CIO offices in Harare but Makiwa again indicated he did not have the required money and Chanakira undertook to pay $140 on his behalf.The State alleges Makiwa then advised his mother Constance Mhlanga who became suspicious about the move and alerted the police leading to Chanakira s arrest.Linda Gadzikwa appeared for the State.
