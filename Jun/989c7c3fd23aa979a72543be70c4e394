Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) former president, Cuthbert Dube and ex-chief executive officer, Jonathan Mashingaidze s debts continue to haunt the country s football governing body after a local travel agent approached the court seeking to garnishee the association s bank accounts. BY CHARLES LAITONCuthbert DubeThe firm, Travel Bureau, which trades as Arena Travel, filed a court application on Monday this week through its managing director, Tendai Gutu, seeking to garnish Zifa s Steward Bank accounts for over $27 870 owed by the football governing body for air tickets issued to the Young Warriors for a trip to Cameroon in 2015 for an All-Africa Games qualifier. This is an application for an order that any money due or becoming due in the future to the judgment debtor (Zifa) by the garnishee (Steward Bank) &#8230; deposited or transferred into account number 1001172359 and account number 100142926, be attached in terms of Order 42, Rule 337 of the High Court Rules, 1971, Gutu said. On December 16, 2015, applicant/judgment creditor (Arena Travel) obtained an order under case number HC10680/15, in this court, against the judgment debtor Jonathan Mashingaidze and Cuthbert Dube, for payment of the sum of $27 870 jointly and severally, plus interest at 5% per annum from May 26, 2015 to date of full payment. The judgment debtor has not abided by the order in that it has not paid the judgment creditor the money it owes, despite the fact that it makes income through its various football activities. Gutu said he believed Zifa was getting its cash through Steward Bank from other sources, among them the Premier Soccer League, and, as such, wanted the court to grant the garnishee order against the said accounts. All the monies received in these accounts are in the custody of the garnishee, which holds the money on behalf of the judgment debtor and pays it out as and when the judgment debtor requires use of the money, he said. The judgment creditor seeks an order to attach any funds held, deposited or transferred into the two accounts until its debt is satisfied by the judgment debtor Gutu also said his firm was continually incurring legal costs, which could have been easily avoided, urging the court to show its displeasure by granting the application with costs on a higher scale.Zifa is yet to responded to the application.
