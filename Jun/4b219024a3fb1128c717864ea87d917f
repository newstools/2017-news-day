BY PAIDAMOYO MUZULUThe prominent businessman, who had his exclusive deal to supply Harare City Council with water treatment chemicals cancelled in 2010, failed to pay an unspecified amount of money to Godwin Kwinjo, who recently got a writ of execution to attach the businessman s property.The Mutoko Messenger of Court yesterday confirmed that Chapfika s property would go under the hammer today in a public auction. It is true that we will be going ahead with the sale tomorrow (today) and there is no reserve price on the items to be auctioned, the Messenger of Court said.Among the property listed for auctioning are a water pump, two generators, chairs, carpets, side tables, projector and dining set with a table and nine chairs.The sale would also include two display units, two expensive chairs, a wall display unit, snooker table, yellow chairs, a wine tray, ice maker, fridge, microwave, small fridge, one bed, wall mirror, side display and two sofas.Chapfika is also set to lose bedroom suites that include a main bedroom suite, main bedroom sofas, chair, two bar chairs, book shelf and other state-of-the-art furniture listed as executive in the court papers.In 2014, Chapfika also lost property valued at $21 000 that was attached after he failed to repay a debt to Nelhurst Trading.The property was attached from his Glen Lorne house along Enterprise Road in Harare.Many businesspeople have been struggling to service their debts as the economy continues to contract, leaving those owed with no option, but to attach property.
