So it is important for us to also offer our cash via the ATMs and we will continue to monitor developments in the market. We might reduce the limits but our intention is to continue to offer cash via the branches, she said. We encourage also our clients to use their debit cards in shops. As MBCA, we launched our point-of-sale (POS) acquiring service, we now have POS machines that we are putting in shops as MBCA. I think for now it is 500 POS machines.
