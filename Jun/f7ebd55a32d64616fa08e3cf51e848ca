Music video director, Vusa Blaqs Hlatshwayo appears to have had a change of heart following his public announcement that he was quitting video productions. BY PRECIOUS CHIDAVusa BlaqsThe announcement had triggered disappointment, as Blaqs is credited with producing breathtaking videos for local rapper, ExQ and Ammara Brown, among other musicians.Blaqs returned to direct Military Touch Movement s video for the song Chekeche, before working on songbird, Varaidzo Nyakunika s video for the song, Baby Yo.Blaqs said he believed the Baby Yo video was his best to date. I think it s one of the most artistic music videos ever done in Zimbabwe because it&#8217;s not so direct. It doesn t say things out in the open, but still maintains the song s narrative, he told NewsDay recently. To be honest, it&#8217;s my favourite music video because it gave me a chance to express myself in an artistic fashion. Blaqs said he was grateful for the success of the video, which he says will remain in people s hearts. I enjoyed the project because it had less hassles and went according to plan and I am happy that this video is out because it&#8217;s a legacy project and, later on, people are going to look back at it and appreciate, he said.The video employs a lot of symbolism through the use of mannequins, which seem to represent a dead relationship.The dolls start off close to each other, before they start drifting away from each other showing a growing gap between lovers up to the end of that relationship.
