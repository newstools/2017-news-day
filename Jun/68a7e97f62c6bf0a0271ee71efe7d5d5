Liberty has been very consistent in all the matches he has played for us while Walter Mukanga and Byron Madzokere who are also out due to injuries have been playing very well.

We have managed to notch five wins in a row, so that is giving is giving us a lot of confidence but we are also aware that we are meeting a difficult opponent. Chapungu has been on a revival and have managed to pick up points at home and away so we are fully aware of and are preparing accordingly. We ve gone for five games winning on the trot which is good but sometimes it can also be dangerous because the players can become complacent but we ve been working more on their mental side of the game than the other aspects, he said.Chapungu are also unbeaten in their last five matches where they have managed to collect two wins and three draws to move out of the relegation zone.
