GWERU City Council has admitted its failure to provide adequate water supplies to its growing population, with most suburbs running without the precious liquid for days on end. by STEPHEN CHADENGAMayor Charles Chikozho said the local authority was working on modalities to upgrade its pumping systems to ensure all areas received water. Council is currently pumping 45 mega litres per day against a demand of 60 mega litres, Chikozho said. We are doing everything possible to rehabilitate the pumping system so that we pump at least 60 mega litres per day Chikozho said the city required at least six water pumps to operate at full capacity, although it was currently relying on two pumps.Over the years stakeholders have blamed the city s water woes on dilapidated water infrastructure which has been in use for more than three decades.
