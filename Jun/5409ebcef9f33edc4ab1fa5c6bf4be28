MDC-T vice-president Nelson Chamisa has described President Robert Mugabe as an inept leader for failing to groom a successor in his 37-year rule, saying good leadership is able to nurture a successor. BY OBEY MANAYITINelson Chamisa,In an interview yesterday, Chamisa said all that Mugabe had exhibited were qualities of a bad leader. Good leadership is when you are able to lead and leave. A good leader must also be worried about the happiness of the citizens. A good leader must unite rather than divide, he said. It should worry a good leader that we have so many bad roads that you have people literally dying every week on account of accidents because of dilapidated roads. A good leader must be worried that pensioners are spending time in queues, queuing for $50 pension entitlements and a good leader must worry that factories are closing every day. Last week, Chamisa told Ruvheneko Parirenyatwa on her Facebook livestreaming platform that the failure by Mugabe to groom a successor was a sign of poor leadership. You cannot be the only tower light in the street, he said in reference to Mugabe s desire to be viewed as the only capable leader.
