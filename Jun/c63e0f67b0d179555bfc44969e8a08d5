GOSPEL songbird Martha Shonhiwa cannot resist the pull of home. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOMartha ShonhiwaFollowing the release of her second album, Grace, she has made the great trek home from her South Africa base to promote the new nine-track offering.As part of the album promotion campaign, she has so far staged shows in Mufakose, Epworth and Chitungwiza and shared the stage with Togarepi Chivaviro, Sebastian Magacha, Leonard Zhakata and Tatenda Mahachi. The album, which was recorded at Nduru Studios in South Africa, was released in March. Shonhiwa s stay in South Africa could have rubbed off on her as she told NewsDay that on her second album, she adopted the beat popularised by South African music star Dan Tshanda and Matshikos.Popularly known as splash music, it finely blends reggae, soul and mbaqanga to produce a unique, catchy sound. My latest album is inspired by my life experiences on how God has been faithful to me, my family and what I went through when I recorded it [the album]. It was not an easy journey because I lost my producer, Lucky Lekuka, before we finished recording, Shonhiwa said.The album, which follows her 2011 debut, Kuzomutenda, carries the tracks Mighty God, Ebenezer, My Life, Makanaka Jesu, All the Glory, Rapha, Reach Out, Ngobekezela and Alpha and Omega.Shonhiwa said she is happy that her music has been well-received judging from the positive response she is getting during live shows. From the live shows I have staged so far, I was overwhelmed by the encouraging responses from the people, which shows that my music is being appreciated, she said.
