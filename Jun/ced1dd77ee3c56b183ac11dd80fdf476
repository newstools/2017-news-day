PREMIER arts fiesta Shoko Festival has added new flavour to the 2017 programme which will see the inaugural Zimbabwe Hip-hop Summit on September 30 to discuss the state of the genre. BY PRECIOUS CHIDAPlot MhakoThe one-day convention is expected to bring together artistes and other stakeholders to dialogue on the state of the hip-hop culture and industry in the country and beyond.Hip-hop promoter, Plot Mhako told NewsDay last week that the idea to introduce the event came after the realisation that the hip-hop sector needed panel-beating . The realisation that hip-hop in Zimbabwe has suffered stagnation despite producing a lot of talent, from production to performance, drove us to launch the summit, he said.Mhako said the meeting is aimed at securing growth in Zimbabwean hip-hop to match the standards of other countries. Today, South Africa s music industry has a success story to tell and that took years to build. Sadly, our industry continues to suffer stunted growth despite boasting of amazing hip-hop talent, therefore, Zim hip-hop Summit is about building bridges on a myriad of levels, bringing local and some international hip-hop players to exchange information and explore ways of ensuring growth and sustainability, he said.The conference has Mhako partnering with Awa Khiwe, a hip-hop artiste and poet based in Germany, hip-hop activist Darryl Nyamutsamba, Jibilika Dance Trust and Shoko Festival.Organisers of the event said they are looking forward to having speakers from key hip-hop industry players like MTV Africa, Trace Africa as well as artiste s managers and production company representatives from South Africa.Topics to be discussed will include lyricism, production of music, video marketing and distribution in a digital world.
