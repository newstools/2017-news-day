I will suffer irreparable damage or harm if my salary is lost and would not be able to replace it. This matter is urgent due to the fact that Wadyajena is denying me and my family which include young children the right to enjoy life as such are living like destitutes, Dungwe submitted.According to Dungwe, he worked for Mayor Logistics from March 2011 up to December 2016, earning $470 as a supervisor.Dungwe alleges upon termination of employment, Wadyajena owed him $6 840 plus other costs like dismissal and gratitude costs, which the MP had ignored and neglected to pay.
