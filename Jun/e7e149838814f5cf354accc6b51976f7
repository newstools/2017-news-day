The deal was sealed on Tuesday afternoon. This is a great opening for us. When we took our works for mastering at the production house we never knew one day they would take interest until after we were working on Maranatha and suddenly they started enquiring on whether we had signed with any SA distributor. I must also say the collabo we did with Tuku also helped a lot because when they heard it, that s when they called us to give them all our music for a listening session, he said.Chivaviro recently released the song Handinyarare featuring music superstar Oliver Mtukudzi.He said Kubashe has selected 10 songs from his albums for a compilation album to be titled Handinyarare The Best of Rev TT Chivaviro 2. As I speak, we are now working on the compilation album of the potential hits which Kubashe himself selected and we already have a heavy schedule of radio and various media interviews set for us in the coming weeks, he said.The stable has worked with renowned musicians including Sipho Makhabane, Shongwe, Michael Jackson and Shakira.
