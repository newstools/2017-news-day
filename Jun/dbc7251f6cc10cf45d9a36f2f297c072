THE government has ordered Austrian contractor, Geiger International, which won the tender for the dualisation of the Harare-Beitbridge Highway, to compensate villagers and businesses likely to be displaced by the project. By Tatenda ChitaguJoram GumboThe $984 million project, commissioned last month by President Robert Mugabe on a build, operate and transfer basis, is set to be completed in the next three years.Transport and Infrastructure Development minister Joram Gumbo yesterday said the contractor would foot the compensation costs. The contractor, Geiger International, will face the compensation needs of those living near the road, whose properties will be affected. We gave the tender to it. So when they reach to a point where people need to be compensated, they will then know where the compensation money will come from. I am not the one to speak on the issue. Talk to them, he said.Gumbo, however, could not reveal the amount required to compensate the villagers, as well as businesses that would be affected by the project.Strenuous efforts to contact officials at Geiger International s Harare offices were fruitless, although sources in the Transport ministry said the compensation bill was expected to run into millions of dollars.The government is struggling to compensate villagers affected by national infrastructure projects, particularly the 18 000 villagers displaced by the Tokwe-Mukosi Dam in Chivi district.To date, the government has only managed to pay $5 million compensation out of the required $9 million.
