(Should we engage in prostitution for fees?) The State alleges the pastor and other protesters became violent and armed themselves with stones, with which they pelted the UZ security personnel, who had tried to restrain them from carrying out the illegal demonstration.It is alleged the suspects were eventually overpowered by the reinforced UZ security personnel, who were now armed with baton sticks.Upon seeing police officers, Mawarire and Chihota allegedly tried to escape in a car, but were arrested, while their alleged accomplices fled from the scene.Sebastian Mutizirwa appeared for the State.
