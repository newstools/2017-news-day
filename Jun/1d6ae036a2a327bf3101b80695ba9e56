THE newly-elected Bulawayo Basketball Association (BBA) board is considering enlisting academies into their league programme for the 2017/2018 season and spreading the game to the western suburbs when the league starts after the National Youth Games in August. BY FORTUNE MBELEThe board, led by Darlington Chafara, was appointed at the association s elective annual general meeting held on June 10.Secretary Admire Chafa, who replaced Howard Pangwana, yesterday said the meeting resolved to register academies in the BBA League. We are going to welcome academies into the league and for women we will be looking at taking those aged 15 and above, while for the men, we will be looking at those academies with players aged 16 and above. We also want to spread the game to the western suburbs when the season starts because most of our players come from there, Chafa said.He said they had approached Bulawayo City Council to use the tennis courts in Tshabalala and were also eyeing the netball courts at White City Stadium and Nkulumane High School as possible facilities to spread the league to these areas.BBA League games have previously been played at Khanyisile Sports Centre (formerly Bulawayo Club for the Disabled) in North End and at Bulawayo Municipal Sports Club in Famona. We are currently working on a pre-season tournament and also assisting in coming up with Bulawayo teams preparing them for the National Youth Games. After that, we will then start the league, Chafa said.The new basketball leadership in the city has Chafara as president taking over from Opportunity Moyo, and Chafa as secretary.Former secretary Pangwana is the new treasurer while Sinda Mono, Estelle Masiyambumbi, Sharmaine Chirinda, Bulelo Mangoma and Tatenda Mumbengegwi were voted into the technical, women and youth, competitions, athletes and marketing and promotions committees, respectively. The BBA league currently consists of Lakers, Southern Mavericks, National University of Science and Technology, Lupane State University and Highlanders, which have men and women s teams, and Giants, Ostrich, City Knights and Oilers with only men s teams.Divas and Angels are women s only clubs.
