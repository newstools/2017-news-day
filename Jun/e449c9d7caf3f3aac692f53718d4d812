The team has made us very proud and I m confident this is the beginning of bigger things for ladies golf, Mtsambiwa told NewsDay Weekender Sport from Zambia yesterday. Like I said before the tournament, we came to Zambia with the aim of bringing back the trophy and for sure we did it in style. From the opening day we were unstoppable and we took a 12-point lead and the girls never looked back. We had not won this tournament for a long time, in fact the last time we won was in 2003 so this is a great achievement. The Zimbabwean girls are now set to challenge the hosts and Kenyans in today s first round of the Zambian Ladies Open Championship to be staged also at Lusaka Golf Club.
