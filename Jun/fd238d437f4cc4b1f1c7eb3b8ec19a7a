ZIMBABWE s preparations for the annual SA Rugby Youth Weeks to be held across different provinces in South Africa in July have gathered momentum following the completion of a two-day trial stint for the U14, U16 and U18 age group teams last weekend. BY DANIEL NHAKANISOA total of five age-group squads ranging from U14 to U18 will compete in their respective competitions against the best teams from South Africa and Namibia at Grey College in Bloemfontein and St Stithians College, Johannesburg, from July 3 to 22.As the countdown to the tournaments begins, some of the squads were selected during the Old Mutual ZRU age group trials held on Friday and Saturday.Falcon College in Esigodini hosted the U14 selection trials, while the tryouts for the U16 and U18 teams took place at Gateway High School in the capital.The U18 girls team selection process started during the Dairibord Rugby Festival, with the selectors identifying a 30-member squad that is currently participating in regular high-performance sessions.ZRU acting director of rugby, Nsikelelo Sibanda said they were happy with the way the trials were done and paid tribute to their sponsors, Old Mutual, for their continued support towards junior rugby in the country. There is always room for improvement, but generally, I was pleased with the way trials were done. On the field of play, I believe, as has always been the case, they (the trials) yet again showed the abundant talent that we have at age group level and I m sure the coaches will have a tough task in coming up with the final teams, Sibanda said. We are also very grateful to Old Mutual for their continued support, which has made it much easier for us to successfully host these trials. Old Mutual s support was very crucial as they took care of the transport, meals and accommodation for the visiting provinces that needed assistance. This is in addition to their sponsorship of the various age group teams, which has played an important role in the growth of rugby in this country, he said.Zimbabwe will this year field an additional national select junior side in the Academy Week, which runs concurrently with the U18 Craven Week tournament, as part of ZRU s efforts to broaden the country s player base.Before the inclusion of the Academy side, Zimbabwe has in recent years fielded four national junior teams in the SA Rugby Youth Weeks tournaments the Under-13 Coca-Cola Craven Week, Grant-Khomo Week for the Under-16 sides, the Under-18 Coca-Cola Craven Week and the U18 Girls Youth Week.All teams are sponsored by Old Mutual Zimbabwe as part of their broad sponsorship of local schools rugby, covering development of teams in disadvantaged communities, tag rugby as well as provincial and national select sides.Some of the country s top rugby players, such as capped Springboks Brian Mujati, Tonderai Chavhanga and Tendai Mtawarira and several Zimbabwe national team players have represented Zimbabwe Schools at the Craven Week, one of the world s largest schoolboy tournaments.
