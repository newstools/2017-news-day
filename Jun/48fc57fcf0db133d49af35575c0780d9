TWO Premier Service Medical Aid Society (PSMAS) members have approached the High Court seeking an order compelling the society to table proposals for the dissolution of the current board on the agenda of its annual general meeting (AGM) slated for today. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEHealth and Child Care ministry secretary Gerald GwinjiMaphios Siamuchembo and Eden Frank Mtambalika cited PSMAS and the Health ministry permanent secretary Gerald Gwinji as respondents.The two s urgent application was filed after the medical aid society allegedly deliberately ignored their motion to dissolve the board at today s meeting.Siamuchembo and Mtambalika are accusing the board of presiding over deteriorating service delivery and mismanagement of the society funds, saying the board was prioritising luxurious lifestyles as evidenced by the acquisitions of top-of-the-range vehicles for management. After receiving information suggesting that the first respondents board (PSMAS) of directors was doing everything in its power to thwart the proposed dissolution motion on June 19, I caused my legal practitioners to write to second respondent (secretary for Health and Child Care) asking him to intervene and ensure a transparent, free and fair electoral process, Siamuchembo said. I now have reasonable apprehension that the first respondent will deviously not include the dissolution motion on the agenda of the AGM and in the process ensure its board of directors cling onto power despite its unprecedented poor performance. I humbly ask the honourable court to take judicial notice of the fact that almost all private health care service providers in Zimbabwe do not accept PSMAS medical aid cards with the result that members have to pay cash from their pockets to access health care. The two men further said they were asking the court to compel PSMAS to take all necessary precautionary measures for the AGM to be conducted in a fair, transparent and credible manner and also to subsequently postpone the meeting to another date.The PSMAS board, which is led by Jeremiah Bvirindi, has been accused of splurging nearly $400 000 on luxury vehicles for its three top executives at a time it is allegedly owing service providers more than $200 million in unsettled claims.
