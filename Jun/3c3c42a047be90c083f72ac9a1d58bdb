HIGHLANDERS head coach Erol Akbay has tipped the Warriors to emerge victors when they face Liberia in the opening 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) Group G football qualifier at the National Sports Stadium on Sunday. BY FORTUNE MBELEThe Dutchman said he followed the Warriors at the 2017 Afcon finals in Gabon early this year and was left impressed with what he saw.Akbay said he was most impressed by the flair and skill of the Warriors players, and believes if they can stick to that style of play, they have a big chance against the physically imposing West Africans. It will depend on what quality of players Liberia have. What I know is that physically, they are a very strong team, though in Africa they have not been doing that well, he said. If the Zimbabweans play good football, I think the Warriors have a good chance against Liberia. All that Zimbabwe have to do is not play a physical game and stick to their own style of play. Most of the Zimbabwean players are small guys and if you are going to play football against the big guys, you have to make sure that you play your own good football and stick to your game plan. The Warriors are expected to win against a Liberia side which arrived in the country yesterday morning without a number of their key players due to various reasons.The home side are also without star player Khama Billiat, who plays for Mamelodi Sundowns in South Africa, due to injury. History favours Zimbabwe to win the match, who comfortably won when the two sides met in a 2010 Afcon qualifier.Then coached by the current Warriors mentor Norman Mapeza, Zimbabwe walloped the Lone Stars 3-0 in Harare, with Khama Billiat, former captain Willard Katsande and Ovidy Karuru, who makes a return to the team in this match, getting the goals.The Warriors then went to Monrovia and forced a 1-1 draw in the return match, with Knowledge Musona scoring his first goal for Zimbabwe.Zimbabwe will be hoping for a good start to their campaign and get a foothold in the group, which also has the Democratic Republic of Congo and Congo Brazzaville, who face each other earlier tomorrow.
