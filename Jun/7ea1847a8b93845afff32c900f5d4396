HARARE Provincial Affairs minister Miriam Chikukwa yesterday chided Affirmative Action Group (AAG) president, Chamu Chiwanza for blocking women from opposition parties from becoming members of the empowerment organisation. BY FIDELITY MHLANGAMiriam ChikukwaSpeaking at the launch of the group s women desk yesterday, Chiwanza had declared that the new set up was restricted to Zanu PF supporters only. We are not apologetic that we prefer Zanu PF women. Most women, who will be in AAG, will be Zanu PF women, he said.However, Chikukwa, who was the guest of honour, said there should be no segregation in women participation based on political affiliation. When we talk about Affirmation Action Group Women Desk (AAGWD), we are not talking about political affiliation. We are talking of women regardless of political affiliation. We don t talk of political parties here. We are all women. It does not matter whether you are Zanu PF or MDC. At my church, I have a business desk, where I interact with anyone regardless of political affiliation, she said.Chikukwa said the AAGWD should set up an economic playing field, build networks of social and economic transformation as well as raising women capacities.Formed in 1994, the AAG has been led by mostly Zanu PF apologists among them Zifa boss, Philip Chiyangwa, Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere and ICT minister Supa Mandiwanzira.
