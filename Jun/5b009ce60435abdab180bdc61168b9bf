HUNDREDS of Bulawayo party lovers who travelled aboard a train to Red Bank enjoyed a thrilling experience at the secret bush party dubbed Lost. BY SINDISO DUBEDj Noma that GirlInitially, none of the party animals had an idea about the venue of the party, but found themselves at Red Bank, a farm located 50km from Bulawayo. Packed in five coaches with one set up as a club, with bars and a DJ area, disco lights people started enjoying the party on their way to the secret venue.Organised by Heritage Stream Safaris and Kingston Brand management agency, the party ran from 10pm till Sunday morning, with the attendants returning to Bulawayo around 11am. Local wheel spinners Noma that Girl, Crazy Dee and DJ Pasee took turns to entertain fans who braved the cold weather. One of the organisers Basil Mapfumo of Heritage Stream Safaris said the party was a good start to more events. This is our first major show and we have learnt from what we saw here. The knowledge and comments we gathered will be a stepping stone to our future events. With Lost, we wanted to bring a different feel to partying. People partied on the train to the venue and back, something people usually get only when it s time for Victoria Falls Carnival, hence we brought the feel to Bulawayo, Mapfumo said. One of the revellers, Charity Jakaza, who travelled all the way from Harare for the party said she really enjoyed the event. It was a great experience partying on the train and landing in an area I didn t know. This is my first time to hear about a place called Red Bank. The wheel spinners kept the mood high, Jakaza said.
