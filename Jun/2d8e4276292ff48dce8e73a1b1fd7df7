Zanu PF is on the verge of amending the Constitution for the first time since it was adopted in 2013, in what could precipitate a sustained attack on Zimbabweans freedoms and rights that are enshrined in the charter. Comment: NewsDay EditorOne of the main issues of the constitution-making exercise was a reduction of government s involvement in every facet of life and the strengthening of the judiciary and the legislature to be watchdogs of the executive.The country celebrated the independent judiciary that has passed some very strong rulings including the scrapping of child marriages and criminal defamation for example, which were the bane of society and the media, respectively.But it seems an independent judiciary is an anathema to Zanu PF, who seem hell-bent on reducing the gains that the Constitution brought by amending the charter to ensure that the President is the one responsible for appointing the Chief Justice.This might seem like an abstract issue for most Zimbabweans, who are preoccupied with finding something to put on the table, but it could be a harbinger for worse things to come, as the government will continue taking away from people s rights.If Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is spearheading the constitutional amendment, was any sincere about his motivations for making changes to the charter, then he would have put the same energy into ensuring that all the country s legislation is aligned to Zimbabwe s supreme law.There are over 300 pieces of laws that need to be aligned to the Constitution, which the government is yet to act on more than four years after the governance charter was adopted.The National Peace and Reconciliation Commission is receiving lip service from the legislature and the government is quiet about devolution of power, which are both enshrined in the Constitution.As alluded to, the Justice ministry and the legislature are yet to act on laws governing child marriages, months after the Constitutional Court ruled these were unconstitutional.This is where the government ought to be expending its energies rather than on amending such a young Constitution.We worry that if the Constitution is amended now, what will stop Zanu PF from amending other laws that guarantee people s freedoms.They will see that it is possible to amend laws, even if Zimbabweans reject such changes at public hearings and go ahead to implement such amendments.Zimbabweans have every reason to be wary about the motivations of those in Zanu PF of amending the Constitution, as it will not end there and soon all freedoms and rights and reduction of government overreach that were celebrated four years ago would be a thing of the past.
