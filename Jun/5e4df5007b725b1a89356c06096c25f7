TALK show host Unique Zimuto s teenage dream to offer a platform for the amplification of young voices in society has materialised through her show, Orbit International. BY KENNEDY NYAVAYAUnique ZimutoThe talk show began its second season two weeks ago and, according to Zimuto, is creating a space and forum where young people get to share their challenges, hopes and aspirations .The 25-year-old Zimuto said the programme, which premiered on local television on January 31, is set to unravel untold stories of the youths. We aim to share young people s untold stories in Zimbabwe, regionally and eventually globally (because) young people have so much to say that s why we had to create such a space and platform, she said.Taking a leaf from the likes of world-acclaimed talk show hosts Oprah Winfrey and Tyra Banks whose concepts focus on issues plaguing society, Zimuto s stance is biased towards young people making a difference in their communities. Since I was 18, I had a dream of creating such a show and of course I had to go through different phases to prepare me but here we are, she said, adding that her prospects are to expand beyond Zimbabwe. At the moment we are still bringing young people within our country in both the urban and rural areas to share their amazing experiences, but soon we&#8217;ll also be going regionally sharing youth all over Africa&#8217;s stories. She said many young people were learning from the talk show drawing inspiration in business, entertainment, sexual reproductive health, sport and fashion. We have messages from young people all the time thanking us for different shows because it helps them also to have a different perspective through the valuable information we give and we motivate them not to give up, she said.
