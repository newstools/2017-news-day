THE issue of roadblocks and use of spikes at police checkpoints is beginning to sound like a broken record, where the country is stuck on one issue and failing to move forward. Comment: NewsDay EditorHome Affairs deputy minister Obedingwa Mguni on Wednesday told Parliament that President Robert Mugabe ordered the reduction of police roadblocks, as these had become an inconvenience to travellers.It is two weeks since Mugabe s directive was issued and there has not been a considerable reduction of police checkpoints during that period.Now that this has been announced in Parliament, we hope the Zimbabwe Republic Police will do the right thing and reduce the number of police roadblocks.It has been mentioned ad nauseam that there are too many police roadblocks and this was having an adverse effect on the country s marketability.Tourists leaving the country also said they were unlikely to recommend Zimbabwe to other visitors because of the roadblocks issue.This is a very pertinent issue, with a bearing on the country s economic health and it beggars belief why authorities have continued to pussyfoot around it.Tourism minister Walter Mzembi has already spoken about this issue and Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa has enjoined the former and Home Affairs minister Ignatius Chombo to thrash out the issue.Now that the highest office in the land has spoken, we hope that the police will heed the advice and immediately scale down the number of mostly unnecessary roadblocks.The claims that roadblocks are meant to ensure the country s security are a disingenuous and elaborate ruse, which everybody knows is untrue.It has been revealed in Parliament that police are making more than $50 million annually in traffic fines and it will not be a stretch to conclude that checkpoints have become somewhat a fundraising issue.While the police may miss out on a huge chunk of money if roadblocks are scaled down, the reality is that the country stands to benefit more were this to happen, as it will ensure free movement of people and goods.There is no telling how much is lost because of the negative perception associated with Zimbabwe due to the numerous police roadblocks.We have argued before and we reiterate that the number of police officers on the country s roads does not portray safety and security to outsiders, but rather conjures images of insecurity and volatility.It is, thus, imperative that the police follow Mugabe s orders and scale down. Failure to do that will mean we continue losing tourists, goodwill and money, which will be readily lapped up by our neighbours.
