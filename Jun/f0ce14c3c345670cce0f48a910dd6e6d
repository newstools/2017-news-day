Upcoming gospel artiste, Takura Shelton Njikizana, aka Taku Styles, has stepped into the limelight after receiving the baton from his elder brother, percussionist and jazz sensation, James Sebede Njikizana. BY PRECIOUS CHIDATaku StylesSebede rocked the music circles with his rare brand of Afro-fusion a few years ago with the video, Izwa. With the grooming and nurturing I have been getting from my brother, Sebede, I have since adopted contemporary Afro-jazz, Njikizana told NewsDay on Friday. Takura, who has been blending hip-hop, dancehall and Afro-pop, said he has improved his work and has roped in Oscar Suwedi Chamba as his producer. He hopes his forthcoming single, Rudorwashe, will rock the airwaves. I have not been getting enough airplay except for my video, Moyo Wangu, which has been playing frequently on ZTV and Christ TV channels. However, I am really hoping for a breakthrough with my new single, Rudorwashe, he said.Taku Styles ventured into music in 2015 with his debut six-track album Moyo Wangu and a few singles, which featured his older brother.The 27-year-old musician said he believed he will scale dizzy heights with his music despite the teething problems he was currently facing. I believe life is never fair, but I am naturally a fighter. I used to blame all misfortunes on my gloomy background, but after studying a lot of great personalities, I realised I will inevitably get to the top, no matter the background, he said.
