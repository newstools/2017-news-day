The Deaf Zimbabwe Trust (DZT) has called on the Primary and Secondary Education ministry to support the inclusion of sign language in the education system, as its absence compromises the quality of education for the deaf pupils. BY Stephen ChadengaIn a statement to mark the International Day of the African Child, DZT executive director, Barbra Nyangairi said there was an urgent need for the ministry to develop a sign language syllabus, as well as sign language resources to support deaf education in the country. The lack of sign language in education for deaf learners continues to compromise the quality (of) education they receive, she said. This in turn limits their opportunities for empowerment. DZT calls upon the ministry of Primary and Secondary Education to address the lack of sign language in deaf education. Nyangairi said the education challenges faced by children with hearing impairments hinder them from being at par with their non-disabled counterparts.She said parents of children with hearing disabilities should be advocates for their children s rights to access equal opportunities in all sectors of the economy. It is, therefore, the responsibility of the parents to ensure that their children, particularly those with disabilities, are afforded equal opportunities and are empowered for independent living, Nyangairi said.Although sign language is regarded as an official language in the Constitution, there are limited resources for pupils with hearing impairments, triggering growing calls over the years for the introduction of a sign language curriculum.Some hospitals have introduced sign language to help deaf patients.
