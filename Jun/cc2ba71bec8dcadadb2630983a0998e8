Although temperatures have dropped this week, top up your fridge with drinks and ice and stretch that juice by adding some chopped fruit to it and make your own signature punch and if you want to add a little kick to it, use vodka.The semi-finalists were tasked to prepare their own vodka cocktail in this round and produced some interesting results, strawberry cream, afrikin spice and the firecracker.Do not forget to pick up a French loaf or two and slice it up, smother it with garlic butter, wrap it in foil and throw it onto your braai. And for your sides, feast with a three-bean salad, potato salad and creamy coleslaw laden with chopped pineapples, nuts and raisins.Kendall, Cherron, Tatenda and Wilson enjoyed this episode while braaing in the open vleis of Mukuvisi Woodlands.
