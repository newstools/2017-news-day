MEIKLES Limited registered a loss of $746 000 for their financial year ended March 31 due to adverse trading conditions mainly associated with the country s poor economic performance. BY TATIRA ZWINOIRAHowever, the loss was better than the prior period s $22,67 million on the back of a strong growth in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).EBITDA measures a company s operating performance.In a statement accompanying the results on Friday, Meikles Limited said a strong EBITDA helped them improve profit-before-tax to $5,3m for the period from a loss of $17,8m in the prior year. The turnaround was achieved primarily due to strong EBITDA growth assisted by absence of impairment charges on investment in Mentor Africa Limited, as well as reduced losses on discounting Treasury Bills, the group said.The performance in the profit-before-tax is what led to the group s improvement in its eventual loss making position by nearly 3 000% to the $746 000 loss.EBITDA increased by 104% to $24,8m for the period from the previous year s $12,2m.The group s overall revenue improved by 0,86% to $457,62m from $453,64m recorded in the prior period boosted by their supermarkets segment. Revenue for the supermarkets grew by 5%, defying the negative effect of depressed consumer demand that prevailed during the entire financial year. Revenue from other segments declined due to adverse trading conditions, Meikles said.The supermarkets segment s grew by nearly $414m in the period under review from $395,29m recorded over the same time frame last year.The supermarket segment was the only one to register growth from Meikles Limited s six revenue generators, namely supermarkets, hotels, agriculture, departmental stores, wholesaling and corporate segments.Meikles registered an improvement in financial costs to $2,13m from $3,62m recorded in the previous year.Net cash generated from operating activities also improvement to $30,8 million for the 2017 financial year from a previous of $20,23 million recorded over the same timeframe last year.Part of it was due to Meikles Limited experiencing a rapid uptake in the Meikles MyCash cards due to the low costs associated with the card in the period under review.The multi-featured bank account, launched early 2016, had 150 000 account holders at the end of the period under review.In an outlook, Meikles Limited said strong marketing would continue to be the group s key focus area across all segments. Initiatives to reduce operating costs further continue in all segments. The restructuring of the group s debt will be completed during the course of the financial year. Efforts to date in this regard are resulting in success, Meikles Limited said.
