FASHION designer Noreen Mangoma has been inspired to use fashion as an expression of the important roles women play in society through her clothing line, Chenesai Brands. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOIn an interview with NewsDay, Mangoma said her vision was to reveal what sustained the African woman through the fashion lens. I am inspired by the complexity of the African woman. She is dignified, poised and industrious hence I combine my passion for fashion with women empowerment and for such a cause, the Chenesai brand aspires to celebrate, encourage and salute her, she said. I make statement fashion pieces at affordable cost and I term it economical styling. I want the world to see the African women through the fashion lens as women empowerment is close to my heart. It is my resolve that with women in the picture Africa will develop faster and better. Mangoma, however, said she has not been spared by financial constraints due to the economic challenges facing the country. There is lack of capital to develop Chenesai Brands into a global marque as the industry is virtually dead. If we are to increase our exports, there has to be an investment in product development, she said.The fashionista also bemoaned theft of intellectual property saying there was no appreciation and respect for other people s creative work. Intellectual property is an aftermath of industry recognition and celebration of the designers as well as their work. You cannot claim rights to something not known, therefore, we must take the industry and its players young and old alike very seriously, she said.Mangoma, who described herself as an industrious woman and goal getter, wears many hats. Besides being a fashion designer, she is a lawyer by profession and holds a Masters degree in International Trade Law and Investment. She is also a motivational speaker, stylist, interior decorator and photographer.
