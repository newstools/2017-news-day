WARRIORS have been handed a major boost ahead of their 2019 Africa Cup of Nations Group G qualifier against Liberia at the National Sports Stadium on Sunday after, the Lone Stars captain, Anthony Laffor was ruled out of the match through injury. BY HENRY MHARAThe winger, who plays for South African side Mamelodi Sundowns, is one of the 14 foreign-based players that Liberia coach, James Debbah had called in camp for the weekend match.However, Sundowns spokesperson, Thulani Thuswa yesterday said the player did not travel to join up with his national teammates who are expected in the country today from Monrovia, due to an unspecified injury, and will miss the match.Laffor did not play in Sundowns Caf Champions league match against Tunisian giants Esperance last weekend, due to the injury.Without their inspirational skipper, the West Africans will pin most of their hopes to get a good result on their Russia based striker Sylvanus Nimely, who plays for Spartak Moscow.The news is a big blow to Liberia, who are generally seen as the weakling in the group, considering they are the lowest ranked on the Fifa rankings.The other two teams in the group are the Democratic Republic of Congo and Congo Brazzaville, who face each other on Saturday.But Liberia has been taking their preparations for this match more seriously, and on Monday, played a warm up match against Sierra Leone in Monrovia, which they won 1-0.Reports suggest that Debbah fielded a largely home based squad for the match, with only three foreign based players, Nimely, Varney Kallon of Kiatamba in India, and Boison Wynney de Souza, who plays in the Spanish Segunda Divisi n B league, featuring in that match.The team s defender, Dikir Glay, who plays in Romania, was earlier this week quoted saying his side are looking to get a positive result at the weekend. It is not going to be an easy match, but we are going for a win or draw in Zimbabwe and then wait for them in Liberia. It s football anything can happen, he was quoted in that country s media.The Persiba Balikpapan defender, who has been a regular for the national team, is optimistic that Liberia will make it through Group G and qualify for the continental showpiece. We are all prepared, we want to go to Afcon 2019, we had the chance to go last year and missed out so now we have to fight as a team to get there. Zimbabwe will start the match as heavy favourites, having dominated their opponents in their only two meetings in 2011 in the Afcon qualifiers.The Warriors beat the Lone Stars 3-0 at the National Sports Stadium, before drawing 1-1 in Monrovia, with Knowledge Musona scoring Zimbabwe s goal on his debut for the senior team.
