TOP gospel music outfit, Mahendere Brothers, are set to rekindle sweet memories of the good old days when they reunite for a live DVD album recording for their latest album, Rebirth, at the Aquatic Complex in Chitungwiza on August 5. BY PRECIOUS CHIDAAmos MahendereMahendere Brothers, fronted by Amos Mahendere, were a household name in gospel music in the early 1990s with hits such as Hupenyu Hwepanyika, Jehovah Ndiye Mufudzi Wangu and Mapisarema 23.Following the disbanding of the group at the turn of the millennium, Michael Mahendere, one of the siblings, who also included Akim and Misheck, went on to carve a successful solo career in music.Michael told NewsDay yesterday that they would perform their old hits and a few tracks from the 10-track new offering. As we revive the group, we will be performing the best of Mahendere Brothers from the old days and also some of the songs from the new album, he said, adding that the songs will include Rumbidzo, Rejoice in the Lord and Mukadzi waPotifa.Michael said the group, which would be composed differently from the past, would only be performing whenever their individual schedules allowed in future. Some of the songs on the new album are done in rhumba and sungura, he said, adding that to give the new work a cutting edge, they enlisted the services of veteran guitarists Clive Mono Mukundu, Antony Gasani and Carven Gumbajera.
