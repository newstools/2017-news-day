NEVER Somanje, who joined the Pengaudzoke band following the death of founder Daiton Somanje, has dumped the outfit citing management crisis. BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA Faheem SomanjeNever left Sulumani Chimbetu s Orchestra Dendera to join his cousin Faheem Somanje, who had taken over Pengaudzoke from his late father, in a move to bolster a united front as the Somanje siblings revived the ensemble s rich legacy.NewsDay established that Never, who doubled as a backing vocalist and dancer, was against new band leader Faheem Somanje s decision to recall Edmore Makoni as the new manager after he had a fallout with Daiton before his death.Makoni joined Faheem last year, but was fired following accusations of mismanagement before bouncing back again recently. It s true that I ve left Pengaudzoke. It s all about management issues. When he [Makoni] left Pengaudzoke back then, he went away with a vehicle he had registered in his name. Moreover, he had received money for upcoming shows and went away with it. Daiton would come home in tears over that and now someone wants us to work with him again. A big no! I cannot work with someone who was a thorn in the flesh to my father [Daiton], he said.Makoni was visible during Pengaudzoke s performance alongside Alick Macheso at The Legends Sports Diner on Saturday, while Never was nowhere to be seen.Faheem also confirmed the development and said he had to recall Makoni because the band members wanted him back. The band members wanted him back. He is a good manager. I did not fire him in the first place, but the band was too small and still struggling. We had no money to pay him, Faheem said.
