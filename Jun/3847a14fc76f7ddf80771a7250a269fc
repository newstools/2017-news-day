Hwange &#8230;.(1) 2 Shabanie MINE (0) 0Hwange finally got it right, registering their first win in eight attempts and their first at home, when they beat Shabanie at the Colliery yesterday. BY TINASHE MUNGAZI IN HWANGEIt was a good response to the players after they were given their salaries, which they claim had been owed for two years.The home side found the opener from the penalty spot, converted by Justin Kaunda on 35th minute following a handball by a Shabanie defender who was trying to clear the ball from the area.Tendai Mathe scored the second on the 73rd minute, when he was sent through by Kaunda to beat Shabanie goalkeeper Samuel Mafukidze and slotted the ball into an empty net.The home side could have added more goals to the scoresheet, but Morestuf Ncube and Dillian Chivandire failed to convert good opportunities that came their way. The visiting side also registered good opportunities and on the 23rd minute when Collin Dhuwa who kept Chapangano defence busy, was denied by goalkeeper Taimon Mvula.A jubilant Hwange gaffer Nation Dube said the recent payment of salaries could have done the trick for his boys. This (salary payments) stimulated the workers to work hard and this win attest to the fact that the team has the potential to win more games. Everyone was putting effort to ensure that we get the win, Dube sid.His counterpart Takesure Chiragwi said: I think we played well unfortunately we conceded a penalty which weakened us. We had so many chances in the first half, but we didn t utilise them.
