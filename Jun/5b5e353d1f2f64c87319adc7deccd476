STRUGGLING Air Zimbabwe is failing to approve a memorandum of understanding (MoU) proposed by the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) three years back in a bid to develop the tourism sector, an official has said. BY MTHANDAZO NYONISpeaking at the Hlanganani/Sanganai 10th anniversary launch in Bulawayo last week, ZTA chief executive officer, Karikoga Kaseke, said they have signed various MoUs with four foreign airlines, but Air Zimbabwe was still not forthcoming. We have got an MoU with Emirates, we have got an MoU with South African Airways, and they are supporting us. We have got a MoU with Kenya Airways, they are supporting us, and we have got an MoU with Ethiopian Airways. Those four we have got MoUs with them and they are supporting us, Kaseke said. Air Zimbabwe, we could have had an MoU with it long time back, but we have not signed the MoU with Air Zimbabwe because they are saying they are still waiting for their board to authorise them, but we gave them an MoU three years back, he said. I m not joking, I am not lying. We gave them a MoU three years back. We are concerned about your national airline. Why are we having an MoU with Ethiopian Airways, why are we having a MoU with South African Airways, why are we having an MoU with Emirates and Kenya Airways? Why are we not having an MoU with Air Zimbabwe? We gave them our MoU proposal (three) years back. Kaseke said Air Zimbabwe management only followed up in meeting with them but their position has not changed. So it s not our fault as ZTA, we need Air Zimbabwe. We need to work with Air Zimbabwe before we can even work with anyone else. Air Zimbabwe is our national carrier. We give them the priority that they deserve and we need to co-operate with them, he said. That is our position as ZTA. But if you proposed an MoUs and they had not signed, what do we do? So there is nothing we can do about Air Zimbabwe. I am so worried about Air Zimbabwe.
