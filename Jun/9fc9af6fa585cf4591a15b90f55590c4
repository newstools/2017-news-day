Chitungwiza residents have expressed disappointment at the progress being made by the caretaker commission running affairs of the council, accusing it of having misplaced priorities. By Tinotenda MunyukwiChitungwiza Residents Trust director Marvellous Kumalo accused the commission of making decisions without consulting residents and pursuing secondary priorities. The major issue at hand that we as residents want addressed first is service delivery, but the commission has done nothing yet. Last week, we had a meeting with them and they suggested renaming 421 roads and we wonder how they pride themselves in renaming a road laden with gullies and potholes, he said.Kumalo also accused the commission of embarking on a human resources audit when no one among its three members had clear human resource expertise.He said residents were contemplating seeking audience with the Local Government ministry to air their grievances especially over how the commission had been given too much power through the terms of reference for their appointment. We want to go to the ministry and have these issues ironed out, and also have the powers of the commission trimmed so that they know they are operating with a mandate to be accountable to residents, he said.Chitungwiza Progressive Residents Association director Admire Zaya said the commission had done nothing to address the deteriorating service delivery with burst sewer pipes becoming the order of the day.
