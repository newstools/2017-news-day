The Light Blue Intense that we launched today [Thursday] is the upgrade of the Light Blue that has been so successful worldwide. It is now available in local shops which include Edgars and Truworths, she said. Light Blue pour Homme is a perfume for modern man that captures the fresh, spicy and sensual scents of the Mediterranean while the Light Blue perfume for woman is a fresh, floral-fruity scent for women that reflects the sensuality of the Mediterranean lifestyle. Roberts said the fragrance was appealing to a lot of people in Africa and has scooped 14 international awards Dolce &#038; Gabbana is doing so well in Africa. Light Blue is flying. As soon as it gets into the stores, it goes off and I think the more support we give to Dolce &#038; Gabbana the better it does and we want to start to revive the brand, she said.The Dolce &#038; Gabbana fashion house, which was started by Italian designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana in 1985, has produced a wide range of fragrances including Dolce &#038; Gabbana Dark, Dolce &#038; Gabbana Blue, Dolce &#038; Gabbana Pink, Dolce &#038; Gabbana Woman One and Dolce &#038; Gabbana Monica.
