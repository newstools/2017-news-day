THE Office of the President and Cabinet, together with the District Development Fund (DDF) have filed an $18 222 lawsuit against a Harare man, who is alleged to have been receiving salaries for over four years despite quitting his job. BY CHARLES LAITONAccording to court papers, Taurai Mavhengere was employed by DDF as a driller between 2004 and June 2014 while working in Mashonaland Central province and being supervised by officials from the DDF offices in Bindura. In terms of the said contract of employment, defendant (Mavhengere), who worked in the remotest parts of the workstation from 2010 to 2014, was entitled to a salary of $174, which increased to $386 being basic salary, transport and housing allowances, DDF said.DDF further said sometime in 2010, Mavhengere was transferred from Mashonaland Central to work and complete some assignments in Mashonaland West province under a supervisor called P Parwizi, who was subsequently discharged from employment. Between January 2010 and May 2010, defendant disappeared from work without any legal authority and without advising any of his immediate superiors, thus, repudiated his employment contract, DDF said. Plaintiffs only discovered of this fact in February 2014 after a comprehensive human resources audit and mounted a criminal case of fraud and theft against the defendant at Harare Central Police Station under IR number 031827. Despite having repudiated his employment contract, defendant, in turn, continued to withdraw his salaries from his personal account from 2010 to sometime in February 2014 regardless of him knowing there was no longer any legal obligation on the plaintiff to pay him and legal right on defendant to accept such payment and withdraw such money. The government said, as a result of the payments made to Mavhengere, the State had suffered an $18 222 prejudice. Mavhengere is yet to enter an appearance to defend.
