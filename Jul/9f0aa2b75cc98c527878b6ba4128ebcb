FAST-bowler Tendai Chatara is in doubt for Zimbabwe s third one-day international (ODI) cricket match against Sri Lanka tomorrow after suffering a knee injury during the second ODI in Galle on Sunday. BY SPORTS REPORTERTendai ChataraZimbabwe team physio Anesu Mupotaringa confirmed Chatara s injury and said they would continue assessing the fast bowler s fitness amid doubt he will be available for tomorrow s match. Chatara sustained a left upper hip flexor injury and had to be taken off the ground on Sunday, Mupotaringa was quoted in the Sri Lankan media yesterday. He is on extensive physio and (we) will be monitoring him on a daily basis as we prepare for our third ODI. His availability will be only be certain after a fitness tests. We try to push it towards the end as possible so that we give him the best chance to pass it since he will have more time to heal, team physio added.As it stands, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe are tied 1-1 in the five-match ODI series after a brilliant, collective batting performance from the latter in the first match, committing the greatest cricketing heist in recent memory.Sri Lanka pulled their socks up for the second round, cleaning up the visitors for a paltry 155 after spinners dominated proceedings by taking eight of the 10 wickets. They comfortably chased the total to level the series.There might be more than just cricket on display when the two teams meet for the third time at Hambantota, a ground situated in close proximity to an elephant reserve housing around 25 members of the wild species who have reportedly broken into the pitch on a few occasions during night time.Regardless, both sides will be hoping that recent renovations mean an improved pitch to play on and an exciting contest for the fans over the course of three matches scheduled at the stadium.The remaining three ODIs will be played in Hambantota ahead of the one-off Test match which will take place at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.
