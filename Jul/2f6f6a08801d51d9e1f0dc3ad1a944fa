A faction of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association, led by Manicaland Provincial Affairs minister Mandiitawepi Chimene, yesterday held a solidarity rally in Bulawayo to pledge its support for President Robert Mugabe s continued stay in power. By LINDA CHINOBVA/NQOBANI NDLOVUTshinga DubeChimene s deputy, George Mlala, said they were not ashamed to be seen supporting Mugabe despite his advanced age. The war veterans are saying the President must comply with the [Zanu PF] constitution, and that the President must comply with the resolutions of the national people s conference held in Victoria Falls and Masvingo, which said he is the sole candidate, come 2018. He still stands for Zanu PF, Mlala told journalists after the solidarity rally held at the ruling party s provincial headquarters, Davis Hall.Chimene s faction is fighting to take over control of the association from former War Veterans minister Christopher Mutsvangwa s executive.Last week, the breakaway faction held a similar rally at Zanu PF s headquarters in Harare, where its leaders said War Veterans minister Tshinga Dube must step down for calling on Mugabe to anoint or groom a successor.Mlala said they would not rest until Dube has been relieved of his ministerial post. Dube has already fired himself from office. He has done absolutely nothing for us. He has embroiled himself in politics. This association and his ministry are supposed to foster or advance the grievances of the war vets to the party and government. Dube has abused that ministry just like Mutsvangwa. Mutsvangwa did his own thing and was removed from the politburo and government. Dube came in and is doing exactly the same thing of wanting to abuse war veterans as knobkerries, he said.Dube last week said after his remarks, he met Mugabe and amicably resolved the fallout with the Zanu PF leader saying his successor would only be chosen at the party congress.
