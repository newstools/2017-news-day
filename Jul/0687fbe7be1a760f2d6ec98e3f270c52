MUTARE-based radio producer, Martin Makaya has ventured into poetry recording as a way of publicising and marketing his unpublished poetry. BY FARAI MATIASHE Martin MakayaMakaya, who produces Diamond FM jingles and advertisements, recently released the audio poem, Horse-Clamp, which encourages people to let go of things over which they have no control.Popularly-known on stage as saMakaya, the poet said the three-minute-long poem was inspired by love. I put love in quotations because it does not exhibit the traditional feeling of love, but rather talks about love. In this case, it s an encouragement to the audience to learn to let go of the things they have no control over. This could cut across different aspects of life, particularly in careers, he said.The 22-year-old, who is also a musician-cum-comedian, said his piece revolved around cynicism. People usually face disillusionment when they fall in love and the solution is the ability to let go and not hold on like a horse clamp, he said.Makaya has joined the bandwagon of stage poets who have migrated to poetry recording in order to publicise their works.He said recording poetry was cheaper and much easier than securing a book deal. I am also looking forward to doing a video for this poetry track if the audience responds well to it and hopefully they will, he said. Horse-Clamp was recorded at Vuvuzela Media Studios in Mutare and launched this month during the Shaurai Music and Poetry monthly session held at Mutare National Arts Gallery.
