The noise over command agriculture continues to increase and there is now need for clarity from the government on allegations of corruption. Comment: NewsDay EditorThe mudslinging by politicians, which has seen even the army commander being involved, should be treated as a red herring, while accusations of graft should be probed by the legislature, the police and the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission.That command agriculture is a reported success does not mean it is beyond scrutiny and responsible authorities should dig deeper.While Higher Education minister Jonathan Moyo s criticism of the programme can be explained away as an extension of Zanu PF s factional wars, opposition players have also waded in and questioned the legality of the project.This should be enough to trigger an investigation and an audit so Zimbabweans know how much taxpayers money, if any, was used and what they stand to benefit from the programme.There are questions about the government s failure to bring details of the loan before Parliament, as envisaged by the Constitution and this deserves answers.Zimbabweans also need to know why the State Procurement Board was bypassed in this deal and whether this was legal.There are also claims that the government is funding the programme instead of Sakunda, as earlier claimed and any projects involving public funds have to be explained in Parliament.The involvement of army boss, General Constantino Chiwenga in defending the project also muddies the waters, as this is a civilian issue and the involvement of the military is enough to trigger scepticism in even the most ardent supporters of command agriculture.This needs a dispassionate approach, where the goal is to find answers rather than serve Zanu PF factional ends.The government is already toying with the idea of command livestock and command content has also been mentioned, thus, there is need for clarity, transparency and accountability in how public funds are used.There should be no room for abuse of public funds and instead authorities should promote openness, which will translate to inclusiveness and participation by all Zimbabweans.If there is nothing amiss, then the government has nothing to lose and everything to gain if it publicises finances to do with the command agriculture programme. This will mean such initiatives will gain popular support in future and silence the naysayers.Failure to do that will see the programme treated with suspicion and questioned at every turn.The country can celebrate the success of command agriculture this year, but this comes when rains were good and every country in the region is expecting a bumper harvest.Being open now about the funding process will win the government faith and support in future years when the rains may not be so good.
