TSHOLOTSHO villagers on Sunday declared they will resist coercion and intimidation by Zanu PF elements ahead of elections expected next year. BY SILAS NKALAThe villagers from Makhaza allegedly braved threats reportedly made by some Zanu PF supporters to block them from attending a Zapu meeting which was attended by over 400 people.Zanu PF legislator for the constituency, Zenzo Sibanda reportedly had conducted his party meeting on Saturday at the same venue.Villagers at the Zapu meeting said they were getting tired of living under threats since independence and would now retaliate if attacked. We have been living in fear of these people for quite a long time and we cannot take it anymore. They have threatened us if we attend this meeting, but we said enough is enough and if they make violence here, we will fight back this time, one villager said.Zapu and Zipra veterans promised to also protect the villagers from Zanu PF s reign of terror, vowing to stop a recurrence of the Gukurahundi atrocities.Zipra Veterans Association national chairman, Ben Ncube said Matabeleland was yet to taste freedom following the fall of the great King Lobhengula at Pupu in 1893.He lamented the greatest violation of freedoms in Zimbabwe had been by a black government rather than the colonial white regime. Zanu PF and its leader (President Robert Mugabe) have worked so hard to deny Zimbabweans their freedom for the past 37 years now, Ncube said. Zapu secretary for cultural affairs, Cosmas Mafu advised the Tsholotsho villagers to be vigilant and on the lookout for actions by Zanu PF that perpetuate Gukurahundi and the now institutionalised suffering of people of Matabeleland under the regime.Matabeleland North Zanu PF chairman, Richard Moyo s mobile number was not reachable yesterday.Contacted for comment Zanu PF spokesperson, Simon Khaya Moyo said he was not aware of the alleged intimidation, but however, said as a party they do not condone violence. Our policy is clear, as a party we do not condone any form of violence, people must carry out their activities in peace. If in any case there is intimidation or violence perpetrated against anyone, they must rush to any police station to make a report, Moyo said.
