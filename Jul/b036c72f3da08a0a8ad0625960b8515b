TOP Zanu PF executives in Manicaland province have been ordered to dig deeper into their pockets to fund day-to-day party activities, amid reports of a severe cash squeeze at the party s provincial offices. BY KENNETH NYANGANIProvincial administration secretary, Kenneth Saruchera confirmed the development at the weekend, saying they were also struggling to buy stationery and fuel to run party business and had their fixed telephone lines cut off over unpaid debts. We are failing to run our day-to-day activities. Our phones at the office were cut off for failing to pay. We don t even have money to buy stationery and fuel, Saruchera said. Energy minister Samuel Undenge has been using his money to finance some activities and I was also trying but this should not be done. Cabinet ministers from the province were each ordered to pay at least $100 per month, deputy ministers $70, legislators $50, central committee and ordinary party members $20 each to oil party activities ahead of next year s crunch general elections. We have endorsed that party members will contribute towards the upkeep of the party every month so that we move as a party, Saruchera said.Most Zanu PF activities in the province used to be bankrolled by diamond mining firms in Chiadzwa before government stopped their operations last year, accusing the firms of syphoning out the gems.The ongoing cash crisis facing the country has also seen some of the party s perennial funders pulling back as others closed shop.
