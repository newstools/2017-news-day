DEPUTY chairperson of a rebel war veterans faction, George Mlala has dismissed claims he did not participate in the liberation struggle. BY NQOBANI NDLOVUMlala s war record was put into question by War Veterans minister Tshinga Dube, who argued that he could not lead former fighters when he was not one of them. I don t know what he (Dube) means when he questions my war credentials. I was vetted, and after all, he is not the right person to say that or question me. I am not fond of talking to the media about people s war history. That is not what is important, but if he wants me to, I will tell it about him, Mlala said. He knows me, and I know him. I am not a bogus war veteran. Mlala on Sunday led a meeting of war veterans at Davies Hall in Bulawayo, demanding that President Robert Mugabe fires Dube.Manicaland Provincial Affairs minister Mandi Chimene leads a faction of war veterans that is struggling to find its space within the ex-fighters of which, Mlala is a leading figure. The Chimene faction has called for Dube s sacking as minister following the career soldier s recent statements that Mugabe must anoint a successor or at the very least groom one.Mlala tried to explain his role in the war. My credentials are very clear. I came back to Zimbabwe in 1980 having finished training at the end of 1973 before deployment. I was in the frontline in 1974, I was in Mozambique in 1976 and in 1978 I was in Lusaka. In 1979, I was still in Zambia and in 1980 I came here commanding the disabled and we opened the Ntabazinduna Hlangabeza rehabilitation centre, Mlala added.Dube rejected any knowledge of Mlala. I just hear his name coming up. He is new to me. He does not impress me. I do not have to be appointed by them to be a minister, Dube was quoted saying.
