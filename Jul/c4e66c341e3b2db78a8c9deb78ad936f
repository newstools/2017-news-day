ZANU PF Manicaland provincial chairman, Samuel Undenge, yesterday dismissed fresh attempts to elbow him out of the provincial executive, describing party members behind the plot as misdirected . BY BLESSED MHLANGASamuel Undenge There have never been any threats to my position, I have always been the chairman, there have been a lot of misconceptions, the party took a position that those people, who were thinking otherwise misdirected themselves, he said. There has never been any disruption or disturbance on my part. Last weekend, Zanu PF youth caused a stir at an inter-district meeting, when they demanded fresh elections for the provincial chairperson, claiming Undenge was imposed on the province, as the party s factional wars escalate.The move was thwarted by provincial youth leader, Mubuso Chinguno, who said the politburo had set aside Undenge s suspension and the matter had been put to rest.
