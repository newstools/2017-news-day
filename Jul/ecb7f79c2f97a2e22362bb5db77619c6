BY TINOTENDA MUNYUKWIPiyo MatosiePiyo Matosie, whose real name is Abel Piyo, is a Chitungwiza-based Afro-jazz fusion musician, who has so far released three singles that are set to make it into his debut album. I have collaborated with Oskid because I am such a big dreamer and I know I have the potential to grow and take my music to Africa, Piyo said.The track, which was produced by renowned Zimbabwean producer, Maselo, will see the 23- year-old musician dropping his fourth track under the record label, Langa Music.His manager and founder of Langa Music, Simon Langa said, he was ecstatic over Piyo s music and believes the collaboration is an opportunity to market the young musician s work not only in Zimbabwe, but to Africa as a whole. I am very happy and I hope this track will eventually take the young man to the Promised Land because as a label, we are focusing on these young Zimbabwean artistes whom we believe once they get the platform, they are able to fully realise their potential, he said.Langa revealed that prospects were looking bright for the artiste as he had forthcoming collaborations with local acts including rapper, Stunner. There are certainly more projects that are coming, and locally we are working on collaborations with Renee, as well as Stunner, once a few operational obligations are met, the projects are certainly coming to fruition, he said.He said due to the current economic hardships they had operational constraints, which included lack of funds to establish studios that support upcoming artistes.
