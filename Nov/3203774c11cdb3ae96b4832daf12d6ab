LOCAL author, Humphrey Chimedza, is set to launch a television talk show, titled The Diaries of Our Legend, which will see aspects of local celebrities’ lives showcased on the silver screen.  BY LIFE & STYLE REPORTER Celebrities set to be featured on the talk show will be drawn from the arts, sport and religious sectors during the programme to be screened on ZTV every Wednesday.  Chimedza said he was excited to introduce his debut show, which was also meant to educate audiences on different career paths. “People have listened to artistes like Soul Jah Love, but they do not really know how he rose to stardom,” he said. “So bringing celebrities like him on the show will help people understand more about career journeys because people need that motivation from those they look up to. “These guys are a real inspiration to the nation and are the ones who need to keep telling us how they managed to make their names for the benefit of the up-and-coming talents.” The writer said he would be going around the country so that his coverage would be nationwide.
