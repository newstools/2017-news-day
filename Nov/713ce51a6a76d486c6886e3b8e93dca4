BULAWAYO City will be sweating over their position in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League today as they take on Bantu Rovers, but not everything is within their own control. BY FORTUNE MBELE City will have to rely on results elsewhere for them to keep their place, but only after they win their own match against the already relegated and basement side Bantu. The municipality side will need ZPC Kariba to beat Hwange for the Mandla Mpofu-coached side to stand a chance. Bulawayo City have 36 points compared to Hwange, who have 37, while Shabanie have 39. Shabanie take on Yadah FC this afternoon, needing just a point to ensure survival. Mpofu admits it’s a tricky situation. “It is no longer in our hands. We just have to channel the energy we have on beating Bantu Rovers. A draw or loss for Hwange in Kariba, then we survive if we win and if Shabanie lose to Yadah, then we must win by a difference of four goals. It’s a tricky situation. It is no longer in our control,” he said. If Hwange win today, they will be assured of another year in the elite
league. It’s trickier for Harare City, who host How Mine at Rufaro Stadium, as a win will take them to 38 points and if they lose or draw, they join Bantu Rovers and Tsholotsho.
