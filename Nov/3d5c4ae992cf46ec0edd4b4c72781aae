CHITUNGWIZA Harmony Singers’ tenor soloist Blessing Chigumira, who died at Kwekwe General Hospital on Tuesday after a fatal car crash along the Gweru–Harare highway, will be buried on Saturday.
BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO  Chigumira’s sister, Ballageen, however said the family was still finalising burial arrangements. “We are waiting for my father to arrive from the DRC. Burial is there on Saturday but there is no agreement yet as to where he will be buried. Some are saying Zororo Cemetery (in Chitungwiza) while others are suggesting Njanja (their rural home),” she said. The choir’s communications and marketing manager, Judith Gwande said Chigumira — who was also the Midlands Province’s Dream Star finalist — died when the commuter omnibus he was travelling in collided with an oncoming car.   “The sad incident happened while he was on his way from Gweru to Harare where he was coming to bury his grandmother,” she said. Gwande described Chigumira, who was studying telecommunications at Midlands State University as one of the best tenor singers in the country. “He was our tenor soloist and undoubtedly one of the best tenors in the country. We will miss his talent immensely,” she said. Mourners are gathered at House Number 7960 in Unit K, near St Aidens Primary School in Chitungwiza.
