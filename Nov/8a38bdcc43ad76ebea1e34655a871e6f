NETHERLANDS ambassador to Zimbabwe Barbara Hellemond yesterday said photojournalists played an important role in society because of the power in pictures in conveying important messages better than words. BY PRECIOUS CHIDA  Speaking at the official opening of a photo exhibition by Zimbabwe Association of Female Photographers (ZAFP) in conjunction with World Press Photo (WPP), HIVOs and the Netherlands Embassy at the National Gallery in Harare, the diplomat said it was important to promote photojournalism and human rights through visual art.  “The critical role of photojournalists cannot be overemphasised. No one can ignore a picture. A single photo can speak louder than several words because it has the ability to capture a moment and convey a powerful message beyond word,” she said.  Hellemond saluted WPP for resurrecting the exhibition after a 10-year sabbatical. “As the Nertherlands embassy, we are honoured that WPP brought in the full exhibition of these powerful images,” she said. ZAFP co-founder Angela Jimu said the exhibition, running under the theme, A Picture Tells a Thousand Words, was meant to encourage Zimbabweans to confront global rights issues. “It is our hope that people in Zimbabwe not only enjoy the images in the exhibition, but that they also challenge you to face the global human rights issues that are addressed particularly at such a pertinent time in our country’s history,” she said.  The WPP works towards developing and promoting quality visual journalism and story-telling across the world.  The exhibition, which will be running until December 15, will showcase different visuals from the 2016 winners of the WPP awards from all over the globe.
