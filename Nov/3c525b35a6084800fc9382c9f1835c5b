South African based Zimbabwean musician Paddy Watts (real name Paddington Watungwa) has roped in Buffalo Souljah to give a cutting edge to his just released single titled ndaenda.   The Kadoma bred Paddy Watts has come up with a unique flavour to African music blending mbira tunes with local beat.
Speaking about the collabo with Buffalo Soulja he sounded excited to have engaged such an African icon who has become recognised throughout Africa and the world over. “Buffalo is an all-time artist who has made a name throughout Africa and overseas, I am so proud to have had a chance to share a single piece with him. Many haven’t gotten such an opportunity” he said Ndaenda is a love song that speaks about love-hate relationships where in most cases hearts are broken down like a dice by ‘rogue’ female lovers.  Having made a name for himself in the musical circles his management has hinted of great expectations to come before year end.  “He has been in and out the studio with great Oliver Mtukudzi. So expect anything from now because there is a lot going on and now  I can safely say we are at an advanced stage with its production” said the management .  In 2014, he landed himself on 41st position on the popular ZimOnLine top 100 list. The song was produced by a South African based hit-maker GT Beats.
