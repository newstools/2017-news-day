SCORES of people yesterday thronged Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport to welcome man-of-the-moment, Jah Prayzah, back home from his tour of Australia. BY KENNEDY NYAVAYA The return was also filmed live on the musician’s Facebook page where other fans who could not go to the airport joined in the celebrations on the 20-minute livestream video captioned “Thank you for the welcome Zimbabwe”. “Sometimes when we write songs you do not know how they will be received but if you look at the period before my tour, a lot of things happened but your support gave me the power to continue working,” Jah Prayzah briefly told the multitudes before embarking on a journey into town.  The singer has in the past few days become a darling even to sworn haters of his music as many could relate to the apparent political innuendos in his songs, especially the title track to his recent album Kutonga Kwaro, during the week leading to former President Robert Mugabe’s resignation. Soon after landing at the airport, his large convoy consisting of fans and close friends’ cars snaked into the city centre where an even larger group of followers disrupted traffic to catch a glimpse, get handshakes and fist bumps from their idol. With horns honking and respectful titles yelled at his sight, the brand ambassador for the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF), who coincidentally flew in a day after incoming President Emmerson Mnangagwa also jetted in, certainly  would not regret any bit of the political inclination. Although he has always adamantly taken an evasive approach, it appears he could not have been more gratified of being thought to be politically aligned as it has widened his constituency of followers. In the recent past, the 2016 MTV Africa Music Awards people’s choice award winner’s name has been dragged into factional politics in the ruling Zanu PF government.
