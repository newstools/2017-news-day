LOCAL fans of Jamaican superstar, Tekno Miles, may need large helpings of patience before they can dance with their idol. BY PHILLIP CHIDAVAENZI The Naija singer — who had been scheduled to stage his maiden show in Zimbabwe at Alexandra Sports Club today — will not be coming this year after concert organisers, Triple Life Entertainment, cancelled the show. Concert spokesperson, Patrick Vijay Hundu, said the show will now be held on February 16, 2018, at the Harare International Conference Centre with a Valentine theme.  He said circumstances beyond their control forced them to reconsider the show.  “While we had been adequately covered for the weather factor, other electrical logistics to ensure the smooth running of the event without projected rain being an impediment have arisen. We have absolutely no control over these factors,” Hundu said in a statement. He said Tekno Miles had agreed to move the show when an indoors venue has been secured. Hundu said Triple Life Entertainment — which brought in Jamaican singer Tarrus Riley recently — was currently in negotiations with other international acts who could perform in the country during the festive season.  Tekno Miles was scheduled to share the stage with dancehall chanter Winky D, Gary Tight, Simba Tagz, ExQ, Takura and wheel spinner DJ Stavo. “We shall continue to liaise with the local artistes previously on the billing to ensure their schedule has them free to perform on the said date,” Hundu said. Born Augustine Miles Kelechi, Tekno Miles is a singer-songwriter, producer, performer and dancer. He enrolled in a music school where he learnt and mastered the rudiments of playing the piano and guitar at the age of eight. His 2015 hit single, Duro, topped several charts in Nigeria before hitting the international scene, peaking at #5 on Capital XTRA’s Afrobeats Chart: Top 10 in September 2015.
