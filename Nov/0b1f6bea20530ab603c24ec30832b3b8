HIGHLANDERS coach Erol Akbay says he has been offered jobs in Kenya, Ghana and Sudan and one national team but is not certain yet where his next port of call will be, dismissing reports that he is now willing to renew his stay at the Bulawayo football giants. BY FORTUNE MBELE Akbay announced in August that he would not renew his contract with the club which ends on December 31, citing the financial situation at the club as his major reason for quitting.  Yesterday the Dutchman said he had received a number of offers although nothing was official yet. “I have some offers outside the country, in Kenya, in Ghana and there is another one in Sudan, but I am not happy about Sudan. I also have got some offers in Indonesia and Thailand. I will see where I want to go. I don’t know yet. There has just been talk and no official offer. And there is also one interest from a national team. I will hear from my agent. There are a lot of opportunities,” Akbay said. He, however, could not be drawn to divulge the names of the clubs or the national team that is after his signature. Despite his contract expiring on December 31, Akbay packs his bags and leaves the country for the Netherlands on Tuesday after his last game against Caps United at Barbourfields Stadium tomorrow.
His departure is by mutual understanding with his employers with chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube stating, his leaving early has to do with his busy flight schedules. Akbay did not rule out coming back to Zimbabwe.    “I would love to come back to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is a football country and to be a coach in a football country is very good. If there is a club in this country that wants me I won’t say no,” he said.
