Yocaf creates the opportunity for young people to develop skills and to utilise those skills to contribute to their communities, which in turn, increase their ability to succeed. Over the years, Yocaf has become a beacon for young people s creative expression and one of the most consistent and sought-out artistic platform, he said.The teacher-in-charge of drama at the school, Bridgett Sayers said it was an honour to be taking part in this year s edition of Hifa showcasing their play, a two dimensional story, which seeks to analyse the relevance of humanity in the 21st century. We have always been keenly following Hifa and now finally we have an opportunity to showcase, my boys are on cloud nine. Hifa has always been closely aligned to young people; it believes in giving young people choices that will help them to develop into creative, productive citizens, Sayers said.Since its inception in 1999, Hifa has received recognition for its support of arts and culture in Zimbabwe and is seen as a major contributor to development in this area unifying local and international artistes.
