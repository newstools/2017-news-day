All our local artistes, who will share the stage with Mafikizolo, have promised superb performances. We are calling for fans to buy tickets in advance to avoid pressure on the day of the show, as we encourage people to move from buying the tickets at the gate, which causes unnecessary congestion with people ending up losing their valuable gadgets. At the concert, Jah Prayzah and Mafikizolo are set for a joint performance, having collaborated on the song Sendekera that, however, appears to have attracted mixed feelings from local fans.
