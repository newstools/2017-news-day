Last week, our junior girls team played their best golf and came second in the All-Africa Junior Championship behind South Africa. Obviously we were very happy with the fighting spirit the girls showed and we hope they will carry on that good form to the All-Africa Junior Championship, she said. We believe the exposure they are getting by playing regular tournaments will strengthen ladies golf even more and we are proud that our Zimbabwe flag keeps flying high. South Africa have dominated the regional competition, claiming five titles since the inaugural event in Botswana in 2007.Zimbabwe finished second at the previous edition of the Regional All-Africa Challenge Trophy played in Windhoek two years ago before going on to claim fourth position out of 16 nations in the continental All-Africa Challenge Trophy held in Tunisia last year.Regional All-Africa Challenge Trophy events are held biennially in West Africa, Southern Africa, North Africa and East/Central Africa and are financially supported by the Royal and Ancient of St Andrews (R&#038;A).The events play an important role in preparing Africa s finest female amateur golfers for the All-African Challenge Trophy.
