VETERAN musician, Leonard Karikoga Zhakata is like fine wine getting better with age, as he continues to make waves on the showbiz scene charming local and regional music promoters. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOLeonard Karikoga ZhakataThe energy he exhibits and his choreography at live shows that have always amazed many is well-complimented with originality that has kept him a household name for a decade.In the face of piracy, where a majority of artistes are struggling, the 48-year-old Zhakata is looking at live shows as the salvation. We thank God that we are surviving. We have been doing many private functions rather than public ones at the moment and the proceeds are good, he said.This Saturday, the Mugove hit maker, who has long carved a niche for himself in the competitive music industry, takes his act across the Limpopo River with a performance at Mphephu Recreational Centre in Thohoyandou in South Africa.He returns to Mzansi after three years, having last performed there in 2014.A day before he crosses the Limpopo River, Zhakata will perform at Maloxo Beer Hall in Beitbridge supported by Eddie Tumbare and Major Chigango. When we return from South Africa, we will be finalising the release of Mutungadzese Extended. This project will have three new songs and carries some remixes of songs from our previous albums, Zhakata said.He said on the forthcoming production, there will be collaborations, but he was not at liberty to disclose the names of the artistes, saying he will do so after they put their voices on the songs.To stake his claim among the country s best, last year, Zhakata made history becoming the first musician to have three of his songs off the latest album Mutungadzese in the annual Radio Zimbabwe Coca-Cola 2016 Top 50 competition.
