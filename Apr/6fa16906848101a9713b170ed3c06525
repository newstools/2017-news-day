Hwange FC . . . . . . . .. 0 Ngezi Platinum Stars . (0) 3NGEZI Platinum Stars made a huge statement by thrashing Hwange in their own backyard in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match played at the Colliery Stadium yesterday. by Tinashe Mungazi in HwangeWashington Pakamisa, Tatenda Machisa and Donald Tegure were all on target for the visiting platinum miners, who recorded their second win in as many matches to shoot to the top of the log.The Tonderai Ndiraya-coached team were the better side in the first half, but they got all their three goals in the second period. Pakamisa opened the scoring on 57 minutes after breaching the home side s defence.Hwange tried to come back into the match, but veteran Gilbert Zulu was denied by Ngezi goalkeeper Nelson Chadya, who produced a good save.A Houdluck Kaunda slip near the box in the 80th minute proved fatal for Hwange, as Tegure easily beat Mvula before sending the ball rolling effortlessly into the gaping net.Chipangano caretaker coach Nation Dube said his boys had put up a brave fight against a formidable Ngezi considering that he was still building his team from scratch following the mass exodus of their experienced players. It s a learning curve for the players. We are, however, learning the hard way. But there is potential in the squad because if they can hold a team like Ngezi for the first 45 minutes, it shows they have it in them, he said.Ndiraya was pleased to see his side cross the line in a tough match. It s refreshing to win, as it was a difficult game. Hwange gave us a good run considering that Nation is still building the team and I see great potential in the youngsters.
