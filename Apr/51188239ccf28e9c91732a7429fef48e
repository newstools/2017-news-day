Back on the quarter-mile track, records are expected to tumble in both the car and motorbike categories, as recorded times have been a lot quicker with each passing season.Last year, Zevgolis set Donnybrook alight when his MR2 became the first locally-driven car to break into the 10-second region clocking 10,89 seconds achieving a top speed of 211,5km per hour in August.Kevin Allmark, steering an AC Cobra, glided home in 11,05 seconds during the same round while Terry Allbery s AC Cobra sped home in 11,6 seconds and the rest of the 10 fastest vehicles achieved times above the 12-second mark.Three-time motorbike champion, Leslie Carlsson produced some daredevil speed, as his Suzuki GSXR motorbike broke into the nine-second barrier in the second round of the series last year.Carlsson s younger brother, Darryl had the second-fastest motorcycle, achieving 10,31 seconds on the quarter-mile stretch and the two are set to offer some exciting duels this season.Fast times last year were attributed to track improvements undertaken by Bitumen World, which means times could be slower this year.
