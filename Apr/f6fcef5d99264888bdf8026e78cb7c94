ZIMBABWE Rural Schools Library Trust received a shot in the arm towards the production of their music album after six New Zealand child goodwill ambassadors joined the fundraising effort. BY PRECIOUS CHIDAThe teen ambassadors, Arlo Oliver, Bronte Harcourt, Eva May Oliver, Ropafadzo Kunaka and Shefali and Shivani Sinha have organised a sausage sizzle event set for this Saturday at Hamilton Supermarket, Park N Save, New Zealand.The six goodwill ambassadors have joined the likes of Faustinah Ndlovu, who has knitted a smaller version of the four-metre doll, Tariro, set to be sold at a raffle to fundraise for the album production.Ndlovu knitted the original Tariro three years ago as the mascot for a project to construct a building to house an early learning centre at Mawandu in rural Rusape.In a statement, the chairperson of the trust in New Zealand, Driden Kunaka commended the young ambassadors, saying their gesture will boost morale among people involved in the project. It is so gratifying when children aged between nine and 14 years come up with a plan to support a project that benefits children in another part of the world. When that happens, we the adults have no choice, but support the children in the initiative, he said. The adult trustees and other well-wishers will be there at the event to support the children. Kunaka said he is confident that the current fundraising activities will enable them to complete the project they are hoping will enlighten people on the significance of reading and libraries through music. This project has been long drawn, and God seems to be sending his people to rescue it, he said. There are several other opportunities that have been presented to us, and I am confident this is our breakthrough moment, and we still call upon others, who appreciate the role of reading and provision of school libraries as an integral part of the learning process to come on board to support us. Music is a powerful tool to disseminate messages and can, therefore, play a crucial role in informing and educating people about the importance of reading and the role libraries play in enabling access to reading material.
