GWERU City Council owes the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) $11 000 in rental fee arrears for two years, amid fears the Midlands capital might fail to participate at this year s business showcase, a senior council official has said. BY STEPHEN CHADENGATown clerk Elizabeth Gwatipedza said in addition to the outstanding rentals, council required a minimum of $40 000, including repairs at its exhibition stand, if it was to attend the annual business extravaganza.The 58th edition of this year s ZITF runs from April 25 to 29 in Bulawayo under the theme Harnessing Linkages for Industrial Development. Gweru City Council did not pay $11 000 rental fees for two years and that outstanding amount has to be settled, Gwatipedza told a full council meeting on Wednesday. Moreover, if council is to exhibit at this year s ZITF edition, a minimum of $40 000 is required. Gwatipedza said the local authority s stand was in a dilapidated state and needed between $8 000 and $15 000 to be rehabilitated.Meanwhile, management and councillors had contradicting resolutions for participation at this year s ZITF, with the former taking a position that council could not participate because of financial constraints, while councillors argued it was necessary to be at the fair to lure investors for the city. It s not just an issue of attending, but we should do research on what we are going to offer at the trade fair, ward 2 councillor Tiripayi Chipondeni (Zanu PF) said.Mayor Charles Chikozho said council now had a new leadership that should work together to weigh the benefits of taking part or not at the ZITF.
