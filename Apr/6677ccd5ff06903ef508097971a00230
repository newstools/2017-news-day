GOSPEL musician, Mathias Mhere is bubbling with confidence that his latest 12-track offering, Old Testament, will be a game changer. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOMathias MhereThe young musician said he has been tested by time and the album, his sixth, has afforded him the opportunity to correct mistakes in his earlier works. When producing an album, you come to realise your mistakes and then rectify them on the next project with advice from the fans, who are the consumers of the product and that is exactly what I did with my latest album Old Testament and the response is awesome, he said.In a bid to introduce a cutting edge to the album and give it a different feel, Mhere said he collaborated with South Africa s Joyous Celebration choir member, Mkhululi Bhebhe, yesteryear music legend, Zex Manatsa and local diva, Bethany Pasinawako.Some of the songs Nhamo Yekuzvipa, Vana VaJesu, Dhindindi Fulltime, Zvinatsei and Error have already made it into the gospel charts on local radio.Mhere said he will continue on that trajectory, as video shooting for Dhindindi Fulltime and Vana VaJesu has already begun in Durban South Africa.Mhere is grateful that he raked in around $10 000 during the album launch, with Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere pledging a residential stand. We survive through music and we expect it to be self-sustaining. We cannot keep on borrowing money after the release of an album. We, at least expect something for our efforts in return he said.Mhere said in June, he will be taking the latest album to his fans in the Diaspora, with a performance in Canada.
