DYNAMOS coach Lloyd Mutasa (pictured) is happy with the team s progress despite the disappointment of throwing away a two-goal advantage to settle for a share of the spoils in their Castle Lager Premier Soccer League clash against Triangle at Gibbo Stadium on Sunday. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKADynamos coach Lloyd MutasaThe Glamour Boys gaffer was pleased with the fact that the team which struggled in the final third despite their dominance in the opening match against FC Platinum finally got it right with two goals while they also had a goal disallowed. We have been creating chances, but failing to convert and I was particularly happy that this time around we managed to score three goals though one was disallowed, Mutasa said yesterday. We, however, lacked concentration towards the end and they scored two goals. But overall, it s an improvement and we hope to continue addressing the weak areas, he added.Dynamos failure to hold on brings back memories of how they threw away a 3-0 lead with five minutes to go in a league match against Caps United last season.Against Triangle, the Glamour Boys raced into the lead after four minutes courtesy of new acquisition Quality Kangadzi, who profited from a set-up by Emmanuel Mandiranga. Mandiranga a former How Mine forward doubled the lead five minutes after the break, as the visitors took control of the proceedings. Kangadzi could have scored a brace, but watched in disappointment when his goal was ruled for offside on the stroke of half-time.However, Dynamos lost concentration at the end with the home team, now under the guidance of Taurai Mangwiro, staging a dramatic comeback which saw Lameck Nhamo and Ronald Mudimu getting on the score sheet in the 64th and 77th minutes, respectively, for a share of the spoils.Last season Dynamos won one match in their five opening matches under Portuguese coach Paulo Jorge Silva and Mutasa, who took over from the Portuguese, has repeatedly said they would want to do better than last term in their first few games of the campaign and then take each game as it comes.With one point in two matches, the Glamour Boys will be looking to grab their first full set of points when they face army side Black Rhinos in their next match of the campaign on Friday.After stuttering to a goalless draw against Premiership newboys Shabanie Mine in their first match of the season a week ago, their rivals Caps United collected maximum points in a 2-1 victory over Harare City on Sunday.DeMbare know they cannot afford another slip-up and they will also need to build confidence among their demanding supporters who expect success this season.Meanwhile, the Premier Soccer League yesterday released a full programme for week three, which will be spread throughout the Easter holidays.The Dynamos vs Black Rhinos match is one of four matches set for Good Friday with Shabanie hosting Bulawayo City, while Chicken Inn face FC Platinum at Luveve.
