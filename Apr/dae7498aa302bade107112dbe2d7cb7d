TWO top Gweru City Council officials were yesterday forced to make a hasty retreat after they were mobbed by vendors and blocked from touring illegal vending sites in the central business district, as the local authority intensified its clean-up campaign. BY Stephen ChadengaActing town clerk, Elizabeth Gwatipedza, and chamber secretary, Vakai Chikwekwe, had to flee from the scene, as angry vendors advanced towards them, protesting the seizure of their goods by municipal police officers. It s now a cat-and-mouse scenario between vendors and municipal police since the latter started the clampdown on us (vendors) a few days ago, Barbara Musara, a vendor, said. So when the vendors identified the top officials in the street, there was a scene to show disapproval of the clampdown. Gwatipedza confirmed the drama, but vowed to continue with the blitz on illegal vendors, who have literally invaded pavements, with some displaying their wares on doorsteps of licenced shops. They were just booing when they recognised us in our council vehicle, she said. But the exercise is ongoing and it s not going to stop and we will work on other strategies to make sure we bring sanity to the informal sector in our city. Gweru Hawkers and Vendors Association acting chairperson, Lovemore Tingaka, however, called for dialogue between council and the informal traders.
