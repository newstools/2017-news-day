Obey ManayitiVice President Emmerson MnangagwaOfficially opening the African Union s first conference of State parties to the Kampala Convention, which deals with internally-displaced persons (IDPs), Mnangagwa said individual countries have a duty to ensure that they deal with pull factors for IDPs, among them violence. It is trite that the primary responsibility for respecting, protecting and promoting the human rights of persons falls squarely on the individual States. This is an integral aspect we must all be alive to when we discuss human rights issues, he said. Accordingly, as internally-displaced persons are first and foremost our nationals, it is our primary responsibility as government to protect them. National responsibility is a core concept of any response to internal displacement.
