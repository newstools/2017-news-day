YOUNG gospel artiste, Kuda Mutsvene, is on a roll. Last Sunday evening, he launched a new album, Ndinonzwa Mazwi, live on local radio. BY TAFADZWA UFUMELIKuda MutsveneThe 10-track album, produced by Nigel Nyangombe and MacDonald MacDee Chidavaenzi, carries other tracks including Era Era and Baba Vedu.The album proves Mutsvene s consistency since bursting onto the local gospel music scene a few years back.The musician released his album, Chirangano, three years ago, which he featured his trendsetting sister, Mercy Mutsvene, on the track, Mhururu, which later became a hit song.While working on the latest album, Mutsvene had an opportunity to travel and perform in countries that included Canada, South Africa and Botswana.Mutsvene, however, expressed his fear that he may not reap much from the album due to piracy, which has become the bane of many a musician. The major challenge that is there in the music industry is piracy which always takes more percentage on what I have worked for, but at the same time it markets you to be heard all over though it s a disadvantage that you have to be marketed this way, he said.Mutsvene, however, revealed that he was trying a new trajectory in the album. My fans have known me producing praise songs but on this particular album, I wanted to show them the other side of my talent by producing worship music, he said.Mutsvene has worked with Sabastian Magacha, his sister Mercy and Zim Praise Choir, among others, in a process that helped hone his skills as a musician. He is currently planning a live worship DVD album recording set for the end of May as part of a project dubbed Into Thy Presence.
