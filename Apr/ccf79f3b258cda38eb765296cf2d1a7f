BULAWAYO rapper Cal_Vin and wheel spinner, DJ Liz have been confirmed as the local acts set to do duty at the Best of Both Worlds show headlined by award-winning South African rapper K.O and Zimbabwe s most sought after chanter Winky D at the Amphitheatre on April 29. BY SINDISO DUBEDJ LizzK.O last performed in Bulawayo five years ago and Cal_ Vin will be sharing the stage with him in his home city for the first time. I feel excited, humbled and honoured at once to be part of this gig, K.O is an African star and every rapper would want to be part of such a list. This is also a good boost for Zim hip-hop as a whole, they keep acknowledging our efforts as artistes, Cal_Vin said. This is also a big event for Bulawayo, as we hardly have such big hip-hop events in the city and we expect a bumper crowd on the night. DJ Liz said she was happy to be rubbing shoulders on stage with the Skhanda God as K.O is also popularly known for the second time after she opened for him a few months ago in Harare. I am happy that K.O is finally coming to our city. I had the privilege to perform with him in Harare, where he left fans asking for me. It s really the best of both worlds because K.O has his own crowd and so has Winky D, so obviously the show will be packed, she said. This will be a good occasion to showcase the talent in Bulawayo which is not put out there for the world to consume. I am excited to be part of this gig.
