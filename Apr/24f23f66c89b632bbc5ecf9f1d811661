Growing up in a rural set-up, things were not well, but thank God, I have soldiered on to be where I am today, as I did not let my childhood and upbringing determine who I become in life. My desire is to inspire youths that one s background does not determine where you are headed in life. One has to be strong if he or she is to achieve life goals, he said. I have organised this event to celebrate my achievements with the community as a way of inspiring them that they can succeed in life regardless of the environment in which they leave in. Apart from his recent projects, Sithole said he is planning to improve the transport situation in the area by introducing some of his buses to ply the route as a way of giving back to the community.
