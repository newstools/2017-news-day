THE Mthwakazi Republic Party (MRP) yesterday said it would release its election manifesto soon and urged the electorate to register for next year s general elections which the secessionist party wants to contest for the first time. By NQOBANI NDLOVUMqondisi MoyoThe party has, however, said it will only contest seats in its perceived strongholds Midlands, Bulawayo and Matabeleland regions.MRP spokesperson, Mbonisi Gumbo, said they were leaving no stone unturned as they readied for next year s polls. The MRP manifesto is almost ready and it will be published at the right time, he said. The MRP leadership has always been willing to take up the challenge, and we have always said we have nothing to lose as people of Matabeleland because we have nothing at all. As long as we campaign and reach out to every corner, we cannot lose, Gumbo said in a message to party supporters.The MRP is pushing for a separate Matabeleland state as the panacea to the region s underdevelopment and marginalisation characterised by, among others, the continued closure of industries.Gumbo added: Those of you who believe that an MRP loss in the election will disturb the restoration agenda, this is the reason why you must fully embrace and support MRP to make sure it does not lose elections. You should register and vote for MRP, because if you believe that a loss for MRP is a loss for all of us, then you should also believe that a win for MRP is a win for all of us. The party recently held a street march in Bulawayo, in what its officials said was an exercise to raise awareness on its secessionist agenda and recruit new members.MRP president, Mqondisi Moyo said similar roadshows will be held in Midlands, Matabeleland North and South, although the party was recently blocked from conducting a procession by Gwanda police.
