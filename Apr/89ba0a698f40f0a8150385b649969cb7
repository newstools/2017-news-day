EVERGREEN urban groover ExQ is set to stage a comeback in Bulawayo, five years after his last show in the City of Kings and, by his own admission, the adrenalin level is running high. BY SINDISO DUBE ExQBut after hogging the limelight with his hit track, Bachura, featuring Ammara Brown, he is likely to take it all in his stride.ExQ has been sharing the stage with Jah Prayzah s Military Touch Movement which also includes Nutty O and Andy Muridzo, but will play solitaire when he descends on Bulawayo s Club Connect tomorrow.With no supporting acts, this will probably be the grand stage to have his mettle tested. The rapper admitted in a recent interview with NewsDay that the bar was high, but he would do his best to deliver to expectations. It s been a while, this is my first show in Bulawayo after I don t know how long, I think it s more than five years since I last performed there (Bulawayo) so I am feeling nervous and chuffed at the same time, he said. Fans should expect a blend of old and new stuff. I will take them on a journey from the early urban grooves era up to date and the future as well. ExQ, who has a huge female following, said working with the Military Touch Movement has paid dividends for him. MTM is working well. We are working on new stuff every day. Visuals are being shot everyday. Next week Nutty O and I will release our video, Let s Talk about It, before our all-star visuals for Chekeche drops in two weeks, he said.He burst onto the scene in early 2000s when urban grooves music was the rage of the moment, releasing enduring hits such as Pandakakuona, Ndichakutevera and Mazirudo.
