Non-revenue water had also increased by 52% from 36 million cubic metres during the first half of 2015 to 55 million cubic metres in 2016. This had countered any anticipated increase in water sales, the committee also heard.Councillors resolved to overhaul the water distribution network and scale up the installation of prepaid water meters to minimise losses.Meanwhile, the council human resources and general purpose committee recommended a dress code to instil discipline among its workers and preserve the city s image. Part of the committee s recommendation read: The objective of the dress code is to standardise dressing and bringing all employees on a common platform whilst upholding the corporate image. The human capital director accordingly recommended adoption of a dress code. The matter was, however, not brought for debate at the full council.
