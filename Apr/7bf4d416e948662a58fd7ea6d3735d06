Outgoing Shabanie Mine coach Wilson Mutekede has urged the Chinda Boys to guard against complacency after a dream start on their return to the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League. BY FORTUNE MBELEThe Zvishavane-based side had to play two giants, Caps United and Highlanders, in their opening fixtures and they came out unscathed collecting four points.Mutekede, who leaves Shabanie Mine to take up his new post as Zifa technical director, yesterday said the two results, where they played out a goalless draw against Caps United, before stunning Highlanders on Sunday, would have taken pressure off the players.Shabanie produced a good performance to beat Bosso 1-0, a result that was barely expected. These points cushion Shabanie against pressure in the event we had not done well in the first opening matches. We were under pressure, playing against big teams, but now we have soaked up that pressure, Mutekede said. However, we need to guard against complacency because getting four points against Caps and Highlanders, the boys can lose focus. They must be very sober about it and try and make sure they keep their feet on the ground. Mutekede believes the Chinda Boys can play better than what they have shown so far. The Premier League missed Shabanie last season. I think as the youngsters play more games and get used to the top-flight league, we will be witnessing a lot of exciting games from them. Mutekede said.Highlanders struggled in the first half, which was controlled by the visitors with Collin Dhuwa, Farai Mupasiri and Charles Makoto running the show in the middle of the park.
