DYNAMOS coach Lloyd, Mutasa has heaped praise on new signing Quality Kangadzi, describing him as their latest football prodigy who is destined for greater heights. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKALloyd MutasaPlucked from the obscurity of lower division football, where he was playing for Trojan Mine, where he scored a stunning free kick against the Glamour Boys, the 25-year-old was unleashed on the Dynamos faithful in a competitive match against FC Platinum on Sunday.And he refused to be weighed down by the pressure of playing before a noisy and sometimes hostile crowd in his debut match, exhibiting close ball control, laced with some flashes of brilliance.While he missed a couple of chances that could have turned the game on its head on Sunday, Mutasa believes he is a rough diamond, which needs a little bit of polishing to become a real gem.The Dynamos gaffer said as his name suggests, Kangadzi has got quality. I think you saw it for yourselves, the reason why we took him on board. He has quality like his name. To me and the technical team, this is the reason why we brought him here. He showed us some of the things he can do and I am sure he is destined for greater heights, Mutasa said in his post-match interview.Dynamos fielded several of their new acquisitions, including Lincoln Zvasiya, Gift Saunyama, Kangadzi and Emmanuel Mandiranga, who all started the match and gave a good account of themselves.But Cameroonian international, Ntoupa Epoupa, whose acquisition had created a lot of hype in the build-up to the match, did not play a part, as his papers are still being processed.The Glamour Boys were comfortably the more dominant side in the first half with FC Platinum struggling for the fluency they are usually associated with, but ultimately Mutasa s men failed to turn possession and chances into goals.They were duly punished as FC Platinum ran out 1-0 winners courtesy of a penalty converted by Winston Mhango at the death of the first half.After this setback, Dynamos embark on a tough trip to Triangle hoping to get a positive result as they seek to mount a serious bid for the championship.
