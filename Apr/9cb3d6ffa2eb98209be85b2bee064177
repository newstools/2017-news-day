HILARIOUS comedian, Lazarus Gringo Boora appears to have hit the wrong button with his latest comedy production, New Gringo Comedy 2017 that has received mixed reactions from his followers, with some discrediting the story line. BY PRECIOUS CHIDALazarus Gringo BooraIt seems Gringo has failed to hit the heights of yesteryear and some of his fans are underwhelmed by his latest efforts, if comments posted on YouTube about the 26-minute production, are anything to go by.Despite focusing on different societal issues that include health, education, politics and corruption at workplaces, this was not enough and did not meet the expectations of many. Poor, why do you have to wear stupid clothes, and use a dumb guy, why should we as Africans consider stupidity and lugubrious as funny, we need and we expect better, Talent Muzeya posted.Another fan suggested Boora go back to working with film producer Enock Chihombori, as their productions were better than his solo effort. I was saddened, as I was hoping to have a good laugh. What a shame, Dyson Chivasa posted. Free advice to you Mr Boora, please work with Enock Chihombori, he is the guy that writes good story lines. This is beyond boring. You will tarnish your image. August Takura, however, had a different view, as he appreciated and defended Gringo for his effort. Good job Mr Lazarus Boora as a human being you cannot be perfect all the time, you cannot be good all the time, but thanks to your efforts, it is just that you wanted to try new flavours for your beloved fans but its great, even though, he said. It is just different and I am sure you did that with a deliberate effort to make us happy. Contacted for comment, Gringo said: Sorry let s get in touch after hours, I am driving now. He was yet to respond to questions sent to him and he was not answering his phone at the time of going to print.
