ZIMBABWE Gender Commission chairperson Margaret Mukahanana Sangarwe has called for the full implementation of the 2013 Constitution to ensure that gender parity is achieved. BY MUNESU NYAKUDYASpeaking at a gender dialogue on women s empowerment in Mudzi on Thursday, Sangarwe said there was need to build consensus on strategies that accelerate equal participation of men and women. There is still major disparity between men and women, boys and girls. This is why the commission is here, she said. The commission cannot achieve this alone without the cooperation of every citizen of Zimbabwe. Sangarwe also said women were still under represented at highest levels in the government, corporate sector and other economic and social institutions. We want to see the next elections having a greater number of women registering or being put forward by their political parties to contest alongside their male counterparts on the basis of equality, she said. We will be talking to different political parties to ensure that their constitutions promote gender equality in line with the Construction of the country. Sangarwe said women entrepreneurs still faced challenges with regards to access to market, credit, financial services, and infrastructure and procurement opportunities. Because of the centrality of women s economic empowerment in achieving gender equality and sustainable development, the commission is looking forward that the Dialogue today will come up with a detailed analysis of barriers to women s economic empowerment and come up with concrete recommendations, she added. Mudzi assistant district administrator Priscilla Mubuto said there was still a gap between men and women in decision-making policies. We want an enabling environment that promote the equality of both men and women in society structures, she said.
