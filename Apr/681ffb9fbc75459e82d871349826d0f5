HOME Affairs minister Ignatius Chombo s recent remarks shooting down opposition parties call for electoral reforms to level the political playing field ahead of the 2018 elections will surely perpetuate the country s political crisis. Comment: NewsDay EditorHome Affairs minister Ignatius ChomboChombo s utterances, which echoed Higher Education minister Jonathan Moyo s Zanu PF will not reform itself out of power rant, are indeed a threat to democracy. The mantras seem to confirm fears that the governing Zanu PF party is spoiling for a fight with the opposition parties in its quest to keep the 2018 election roadmap uneven.The majority of the people had hoped the ongoing negotiations between the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) and opposition under the banner of National Electoral Reform Agenda (Nera) would yield positive results and improve the country s electoral system, but Chombo s expressions have all but confirmed that Zimbabwe s problems are still far from being over.Chombo, who also doubles as Zanu PF administration secretary, in the same interview with the State media last week, insinuated that those calling for electoral reforms were being sponsored by the West to effect regime change.The minister s rants were unfortunate and unforgivable given the majority of people are living in abject poverty due to Zanu PF intransigence.Nera last year held a series of demonstrations demanding electoral reforms, forcing Zec to the negotiating table. But while the negotiations were underway, the Zanu PF government made a U-turn, hijacking the procurement of the biometric voter registration kits from the United Nations Development Fund, claiming it had secured adequate resources for the project.The opposition parties have raised a red flag over the move, suspecting that Zanu PF could be plotting to rig the upcoming elections.In 2013, the opposition MDC-T refused to accept Zanu PF victory and plunged President Robert Mugabe into a legitimacy crisis that has had severe consequences on the country s economy, with the ordinary citizens bearing the brunt of Zanu PF greed.What Chombo has done in his wisdom and/or lack of, is an open admission that Zanu PF has all along been rigging elections and would want the status quo to persist. This validates MDC-T claims that Mugabe had been stealing elections for years using a skewed electoral system.If Zanu PF is governing on a popular mandate as it claims, we believe the party should not be afraid of electoral reforms that aim to create free and fair polls. The governing party should therefore not hide behind a finger by seeing imaginary ghosts and yet claim to be popular. We urge Mugabe and his party top officials to, for at least once, embrace the new system, and we have no doubt that if they have the people s support, no matter the electoral field that exists, they will still romp to victory come the 2018 plebiscite.
