SONGBIRD Plaxedes Wenyika-Joka seemed to have been buried with the death of the urban grooves movement, which made way for the rage of the moment, Zimdancehall, after dishing out a string of classic love ballads including Wadarireiko, Hapana Angandida Sewe and Tisaparadzane. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOPlaxedes Wenyika-JokaBefore going under, the urban grooves genre had unearthed a number of gems in the mould of Lungwisani Sanii Makhalima, twins Roy and Royce Gomo, David Chifunyise, Betty Makaya and Plaxedes herself.With a new single, off her forthcoming album, Plaxedes has announced her return to the stage.The love-themed track, Now I Know, which was released yesterday, hits the market today as a promotional song ahead of the album release scheduled for September.Plaxedes, who last released a song in 2015, told NewsDay that she was upbeat that songs from the album would do well on the market as they reflected her maturity. This is a love song that brings back the original Plaxedes whom music fans used to know when I launched my music career. I feel I am mature enough as a mother, a wife and a professional and with all those elements combined really shows a great change, she said.Plaxedes said she was not in a hurry to release songs, as she wanted to properly time her releases. I am that type of a musician who only releases new stuff when I feel inspired. With resources permitting, I will do the accompanying video of the song, the 36-year-old musician, who will be resuming live concerts soon, said.Plaxedes made her entry into the showbiz in 2002 with the release of her debut album Tisaparadzane and was among the beneficiaries of the 75% local content prescribed by the then Information minister, Jonathan Moyo.She became a household name with the album that was made up of love songs, with the title track topping local charts.
