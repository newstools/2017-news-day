YOUTHFUL Bulawayo pastor, Tawanda Denga, who uses rap music to reach out to his congregation and targets youths, said the genre was created by God even though many are sceptical of it. By Sindiso DubeTawanda DengaGoing by the stage name T1nda, the pastor has been in the youth ministry for a decade now, ministering for Life Spring Church in the city. As a youthful pastor, who uses rap music to minister to the youths, I have faced a lot of challenges and criticism especially from the elderly Christian community, who think rap is a secular phenomenon and associated with the devil, he said. I preach the gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour in gospel music packaged in rap, rap connects me with many youthful souls, who relate to it. This genre has won many souls. Denga went further by quoting a scripture from Colossians 1 verse 16, which says: For in him, all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities, all things have been created through him and for him. That Bible scripture says that all things come from God, the devil never created anything he just takes what God created and perverts it. I believe all forms of music including rap came from God, hence, we should embrace it. T1anda fell in love with music in 1998, he has one album under his name Freedom.He is well known for his tracks Welcome to the City of Kings and No Problemo.T1anda is working on his second album called Higher Definition. He released the album s first single, Majarakara, which simply translated means a thick bush, accompanied by a sizzling video directed by National Arts Merit awards nominee, Onvi TV.
