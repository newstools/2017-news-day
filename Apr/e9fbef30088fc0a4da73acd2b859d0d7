A 26-YEAR-OLD Gweru man, who connived with a self-proclaimed prophet to steal $3 000 from a cross-border trader while pretending to pray for the cash was this week jailed to an effective three years after being convicted of theft. BY Stephen ChadengaThe driver, Sunday Shainai of Ascot Infill in Gweru, connived with a Lalapanzi prophet, Leonard Kambazinga, to rob Esther Chamunorwa s money.Gweru magistrate, Shotgame Musaiona said there was overwhelming evidence that the pair hatched a plan to steal from Chamunorwa.Musaiona sentenced Shainai to four years, but suspended one year on condition of good behaviour.The prophet was convicted last month and is serving a four-year jail term at Hwahwa Prison.The court heard that on February 10 this year, Shainai met Kambazinga in town and informed him that Chamunorwa wanted her money to be prayed for. She intended to use the money to buy a vehicle to use as a commuter omnibus.The pair then proceeded to Chamunorwa s home in Woodlands Park where Shainai remained in the car, while Kambazinga entered the house where their client and her friends were waiting.Kambazinga was given $3 100 wrapped in a white cloth. He reportedly prayed for the money and gave it back to Chamunorwa.Kambazinga then claimed he wanted to pray for the money for the second time and asked that Chamunorwa and her friends leave the room.As they exited, Shainai entered the house pretending that he also required the prophet s services.Kambazinga then gave the money to Shainai, who put it in a satchel and returned to their vehicle.He then put pieces of paper in the white cloth and wrapped them up before inviting his clients back into the house.Kambazinga handed over the package, instructing them not to open it for four months after which he left.However, the following day Chamunorwa s friend said she was suspicious of the prophet and his driver.The two decided to open the cloth and found their money had disappeared.A report was made to the police, leading to the pair s arrest.
