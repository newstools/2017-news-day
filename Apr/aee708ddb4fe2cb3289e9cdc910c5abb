The story of musicians dying as paupers long after the peak of their careers is an old, familiar tale. BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA recently in south AfricaDerrick Ndzimande (left) and Togarepi ChivaviroThose who attended the colourful launch of Togarepi Chivaviro s latest album, Maranatha, at Germiston Prayer Centre in South Africa at the weekend, were reminded of this hard truth.South Africa s gospel music icon, Derrick Ndzimande who was the guest of honour at the launch said it was a pity that gospel artistes often fail to manage their finances at the height of their music careers and end up fighting poverty in the twilight of their lives. I encourage all gospel artistes to manage their funds well. Do not be overwhelmed that this month you got R100 000, the next month R80 000 and the next, some more money. If you are at your peak, handle the finances well so that when your career winds down, you will have something for yourself. Look at me, I am now resting and enjoying life with my wife as I rest from active music, he said.Ndzimande was quick to offer the insight of a tried and tested veteran, urging musicians to live within their means. Gospel artistes should leave within their means. I have often seen artistes refusing to use public transport to go to shows and force themselves to be driven in Mercedes Benz. That s not it. God will reward your work. There is nothing wrong with going to a show in a taxi, he said.Ndzimande urged musicians to respect promoters and their fans as they remain humble, before putting up a thrilling performance. He is expected to grace another album launch tonight at the Anglican Cathedral in Harare, as Chivaviro introduces the album in his home country.Chivaviro s 13th album has 13 songs and features 13 artistes.
