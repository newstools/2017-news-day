The annual Chibuku Neshamwari Traditional Dance Festival sponsors, Delta Beverages, have been forced to reduce the provincial winners prizes and change the registration criteria for this year s edition of the dance showcase to contain costs. BY WINSTONE ANTONIORedwing Traditional Dance Group were crowned the national winners of the 53rd edition of the Chibuku Neshamwari Traditional Dance Festival last yearFor the previous years, aspiring participants would register and subscribe for the festival through the Zimbabwe National Traditional Dance Association (ZNTDA), who are the event s co-ordinator, in partnership with the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ).However, with the new format, the registration of the groups is now being co-ordinated by the sponsors and the groups will be required to purchase two Chibuku Super six packs at any Delta Beverages Centre (DBC), fill in an entry form and attach a receipt onto it with the group s required information and drop it into the entry box provided at any DBCs.While efforts to get a comment from Chibuku brand manager, Karen Dhliwayo were fruitless, ZNTDA s Nyadzisayi Mirisawu confirmed the developments, saying, although they value the sponsors decision and appreciate their support of the festival, they felt, as the custodians of the groups, should have registered through their association. They are geared to start the programme on May 13 with the groups also preparing for the festival. However, this year there are slight changes as the groups will now get the registration forms from Delta s breweries in their areas as per the sponsor s request, she said. For the groups to register, they have to buy two Chibuku Super six packs and fill in their details and drop them in entry boxes for the adjudication process that will be done at our mother body, National Arts Council of Zimbabwe.
