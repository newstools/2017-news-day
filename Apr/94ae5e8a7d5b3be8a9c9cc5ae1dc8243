JOURNALIST and former Southern Eye columnist, Admire Kudita seems to have traded his note book and pen for the microphone, as he launched his debut music project titled Black Love Project Volume 1. BY SINDISO DUBEAdmire KuditaThe eight-track album was first launched on Bulawayo s Skyz Metro FM last week before it was taken to YA FM in the mining town of Zvishavane early this week.In an interview, Kudita said the album is an expressive project with the theme focusing on the need to dump stereotypes and embrace diversity. In an age of hate and negative stereotypes, we need to love the black community, love your brother, and love your sister as they say black is beautiful, he said. My music vision presents a collage of musical influences from the searing soul sounds of Donny Hathaway, Teddy Pendergrass to John Legend, the revolutionary Wailers fronted by Bob Marley, the rhythm and blues of Motown, the evocative gospel music of Andrae Crouch, the ethnic vibe of Chimurenga Mbira and Jit from Bhundu Boys. Some of the tracks on the album are Keep The Fire Burning, Truth, Stand Up for Love, Mending Fences, Everybody Needs Somebody and Breakthrough, which won a National Arts Merit Awards for outstanding music video in 2016. Kudita, a three-time United Kingdom song writing contest finalist, said the album has been well received in Bulawayo and Zvishavane and he will soon be taking it across the country.
