Bulawayo City will be hoping to continue with the form that has seen them win their last two matches when they entertain Castle Lager Premier Soccer League title-hungry FC Platinum at Barbourfields Stadium today. BY FORTUNE MBELELast year, Bulawayo City lost both league matches to FC Platinum, with identical 1-0 scorelines at Barbourfields and Mandava.Coach, Mandla Mpofu acknowledges it will not be easy against the platinum miners, but his boys are ready for the challenge. It s yet another tricky encounter for us and to be realistic, we are playing one of the best teams in the country, a team that is gunning for the championship with quality players and a good coach, he said. It s not going to be easy, but we will strive on hard work, be organised, focused and show character to come up with a positive results. It s early days, but we have to pick up those points and I am happy we are in the right direction. Bulawayo City are banking on skipper and veteran striker, Mkhokheli Dube, who has registered his name twice on the score sheet in the 2-1 win against his former club Chicken Inn at BF and in the 2-0 win against Shabanie Mine at Maglas. He (Dube) is a hard worker and he is pushing the boys to the limit, Mpofu said.They take on FC Platinum, who have won their first two matches, beating Dynamos 1-0 at the National Sports Stadium and Bantu Rovers 3-2 at Maglas.FC Platinum coach, Norman Mapeza, rested his regular players, but after both matches, he would have challenges in coming up with a first 11 because the players that played in the Uhuru Cup were impressive. This is good for us going to the next game. In the next game, the boys will go out with confidence. It s about depth; these guys have done well in the two games that we have played. One or two of them will maybe rested against Bulawayo City, but that will depend on how we are going to train between now and tomorrow (today), he said.
