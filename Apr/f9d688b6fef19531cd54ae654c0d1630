Caps United coach Lloyd Chitembwe is unfazed by the way his team was dominated by Shabanie Mine on Sunday, where the Green Machine can count themselves lucky to have escaped with a point against the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League returnees. BY MUKUDZEI CHINGWERECaps United coach Lloyd ChitembweThe reigning Coach of the Year also brushed aside the impact of the industrial action by his players, who skipped training for the better part of last week protesting over bonus and salary arrears. That is not important [the players strike], we do not want to dwell on negatives, but rather look at the positives, he said.Chitembwe s men came into match day with a spring in their step following last season s coronation and an impeccable Caf Champions League run this season.However, the coach is not getting carried away by previous success and is rather focused on retaining the title this season. From the evidence of Sunday s performance, Chitembwe knows his work is cut out again this season.He refused to look at the match against Shabanie as a reflection of how his charges might fare this term. We don t want to look at history because this belongs to the archives. Even last year, people talked about that [that they might not win the championship], but we managed to go all the way and win the championship. It was a fair result (against Shabanie Mine), the application by both teams was excellent and fans deserve to see such a football match, Chitembwe said.Makepekepe this year will be fighting on two fronts for the better part of the campaign as they seek to conquer the continent as well as the local game.That divided attention might work as an advantage to fellow title chasers domestically and Chitembwe will be on the lookout to juggle his cards properly to be able to fight on both ends.
