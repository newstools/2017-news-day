HARARE City Council has set aside $150 000 to renovate Gwanzura Stadium so that it meets Zifa s standards to host top-flight football. by XOLISANI NCUBEThe facility was barred from hosting Premier Soccer League (PSL) matches during the 2015 season after the local authority failed to renovate the stadium to meet top-flight league standards and this has put pressure on the National Sports Stadium as it is the only venue available for use while Rufaro undergoes a change of turf.As a way to easy pressure on the government-owned stadia and due to increased demand from clubs for stadiums to use during the 2017 season, council resolved to invoke powers vested with mayor Bernard Manyenyeni to get quick cash to fund the renovations. Following discussions, the committee noted the urgency of the matter and resolved that subject to the approval of His Worship, the mayor, council approves the refurbishment of Gwanzura Stadium to meet Zifa and PSL standards at an estimated cost of $150 000 for use during the 2017 PSL season, the minutes read.The refurbishments, according to council, would target enlarging the changing rooms, refurbish public toilets, referees changing room and terraces. Council also wants to construct a medical room, ticket room, repair the security wall, and upgrade turnstiles and media area.
