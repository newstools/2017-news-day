ZANU PF youths in Manicaland have suspended their provincial finance secretary, Taurai Chiripamberi, for allegedly diverting a beast donated for President Robert Mugabe s 93rd birthday celebrations to his own use. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Provincial youth leader, Mubuso Chinguno, exposed the scam at the weekend, saying the beast had been donated to feed party youths, as they travelled for Mugabe s birthday bash in Matobo in February.Chinguno told Zanu PF provincial youth commissar, Innocent Hamandishe, that Chiripamberi led the party s fundraising committee, but chose to operate single-handedly. Boss (Hamandishe), we want to advise you that we suspended our secretary for finance Taurai Chiripamberi. When we conducted our fundraising for the 21st February Movement, we set up a fundraising committee led by Chiripamberi, he said. There was no meeting that was held by Chiripamberi. He ran the show like his own tuckshop. He was given a beast (cow) by well-wishers, so that we could feed our youths when travelling to Matobo, but he converted the beast to his own use, he said. There was no report we received as management from him (Chiripamberi), we tried to contact him, but he was not listening to anyone. All our efforts fell on deaf ears. We did a post-mortem on the matter and we decided to suspend him. We gave him 30 days to respond, but he is yet to come back to us, Chinguno said.Chiripamberi s mobile phone went unanswered.
