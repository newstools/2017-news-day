CAPS United full-back, Ronald Pfumbidzai is refusing to be flattered by their recent dominance over their city rivals Dynamos and will go all out at full throttle as the two sides clash in the semi-final of the Independence Cup at the National Sports Stadium on Sunday. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKAThe Green Machine prevailed in the Big Harare Derby last season, beating Dynamos 1-0 in the first round of the league, their first time in seven years, before coming from 3-0 down with just over five minutes remaining to clinch a pulsating 3-3 draw in the reverse fixture.They have already put one over their number one adversary this year, after a 3-1 victory in the ZNA Charities Shield.That dominance has upset the Dynamos faithful, who see the weekend Independence Cup semi-final as the perfect opportunity for revenge.But Pfumbidzai, one of last season s Soccer Star of the Year finalists, says their performance last season is now history and they want to remain focused as they face DeMbare. We want to win every match and it s always a good feeling, particularly winning against Dynamos. We are looking forward to the match, he said.The Caps United defender, scorer of one of the goals in the 2-1 victory over Harare City at the weekend in the league, has been struggling with a knee injury sustained during the Caf Champions League preliminary round victory over Lesotho champions Lioli.He subsequently missed their recent victory over Dynamos, but is now fully fit and likely to be in the starting 11 to face their old enemy at the weekend.Caps United, however, are likely to rest most of their regulars for this clash, with coach Lloyd Chitembwe likely to give fringe players a chance.Dynamos, on the other hand, will be looking to field their best team, as they seek to regain their dominance over Caps United, as well as get their confidence following a stuttering league start, which saw them falling 1-0 to FC Platinum in the opening match before drawing 2-2 away to Triangle.They see this match as a good opportunity for them to address some grey areas, as they seek to mount a serious challenge on the championship.The other semi-final match pits Highlanders against FC Platinum at Barbourfields Stadium in Bulawayo, with the winners set to clash in the final on Independence Day on Tuesday, while the losers battle for third and fourth place.Defending champions, Chicken Inn will not take part in the competition after the organisers decided to handpick the teams for this year s edition.
