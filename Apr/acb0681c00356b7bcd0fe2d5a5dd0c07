CAPS United coach Lloyd Chitembwe yesterday slammed referee Thabani Bamala after he saw his side lost to Dynamos in the semi-finals of the Independence Trophy at the National Sports Stadium yesterday. BY Kevin Mapasure Chitembwe argued that the referee failed to control the game.The Green Machine played part of the second half with 10 men after defender Valentine Musarurwa was given a red card following a foul on Takunda Sadiki.After the match some Caps united officials had to be restrained as they attempted to manhandle the match officials. The red card was not supposed to have been given in my view. In terms of managing the game the referee should have done better, once players take control of things you lose the essence of competition. Tackles were flying all over so I felt someone was not in control of the situation. The match could have been better had it been handled well, Chitembwe said.Dynamos had to make two first half substitutions following injuries that came about after hard tackles.Despite his complaints about the referees Chitembwe was pleased with the level of competition displayed by both sets of players.He said that the result did not quite reflect the way the match had been played. I think we played the way we wanted to play and were in control. The result does not reflect the way the match was played. I am very happy with the way my boys played today. Lloyd Mutasa on the other hand was pleased with both the outcome and performance by his players. I think it was quite a competitive game and the two teams had to be separated by just one goal. I am happy that we finally got to win over Caps and I hope this gives us confidence going forward. We needed to win against a big team so that we boost our confidence and I am happy that we managed to get the result today. Dynamos got the win through a second half goal which was claimed by both Ocean Mushure and striker Christian Ntouba.The match officials, however, recorded Mushure as the scorer.
