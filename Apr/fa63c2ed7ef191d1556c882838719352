PRESIDENT Robert Mugabe has been accused of stifling the implementation of relevant constitutional amendments to economically and socially empower women. BY SHARON SIBINDIPDP secretary-general Gorden MoyoSpeaking during a Gender Forum hosted by the Women s Institute for Leadership and Development, People s Democratic Party secretary-general, Gorden Moyo said the Constitution was not being followed to the letter and spirit, hence, delays in the implementation of statutes contained in the charter adopted in 2013. We believe in working with others and the people of Bulawayo should not discriminate each other because of partyism, let us work together and fight this gender discrimination issue, he said. Let s work together to emancipate women and youths to participate in the next election. We believe that women have the right, the capacity, skill and competence to run this country (and) the city of Bulawayo, to become MPs, senators and (they have the) passion to do it. MDC leader, Welshman Ncube said equal rights between men and women only exist on paper, but were not being exercised. There should be participation representation systems and policies that will enable women to hold positions of power. There is need for a new government that will ensure this, he said. The next election will use BVR (biometric voter registration) and youths must participate as there are new technologies. Zapu leader, Dumiso Dabengwa challenged women and youths to fight for their rights. The youth are looking up to elders, while we expect them to be at the forefront. Women must change and not wait for men to do things, he said.The government s failure to align laws to the Constitution is often blamed for stalling the country s development agenda.For example, in spite of child marriages being ruled to be against the Constitution, Parliament is yet to pass a law that outlaws marriages of minors below the age of 18.
