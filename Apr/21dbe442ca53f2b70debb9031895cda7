NEW Zealand-based Zimbabwean Faustinah Ndlovu has knitted a four-metre doll named Tariro to be sold at a raffle to raise money towards the production of the Zimbabwe Rural Schools Library Trust s (ZRSLT) music album. BY PRECIOUS CHIDAThe trust has for the past two years been working on the production that carries messages encouraging people to read and use library services, as well as lobbying authorities to invest in library development, but the project has been delayed due to financial constraints.Ndlovu knitted the four-metre doll three years ago as the icon of a project to construct a building to house the early learning centre at Mawandu in rural Rusape.In a statement, Ndlovu said she wanted to help in funding the project as she was aware of the constraints that the trust was undergoing. I am aware of the financial challenges the trust is experiencing in this mammoth project and I thought I could use my hands to contribute towards the project s finalisation , she said.New Zealand-based project sponsor, Driden Kunaka expressed gratitude over Ndlovu s gesture and appealed to other well-wishers to help with what they could. Faustinah s offer came at a time when some of us on the trust were slowly giving up hope, but the timely support has spurred those who were giving up hope into action , Kunaka said. Faustinah is innovative and always thinks outside the square when presented with a challenge and usually comes up with winning and workable solutions. We will sell the doll by raffle and I am confident the New Zealanders will support the cause, and that money raised from the raffle will go a long way towards fulfilling our goal .Kunaka said other fundraising initiatives to complete the project were also underway adding that progress has been made on the album. He said they are going to add a few songs from musicians, who were interested in the project. We have nearly enough songs for an album now, but we had a few more musicians who had shown interest and we do not want to shut them out , Kunaka said. Songs have been made for the album by eight musicians, who include Charles Charamba, Denzel Mombeyarara, Elvis Muchenje, Faith Kunaka, Hamilton West School (New Zealand), Jeys Marabini, Lloyd Mukumba and Sandra Ndebele-Sibindi. He said, to give the public a taste of what is to come, the trust selected songs by Marabini, Lloyd Mukumba and Hamilton West School for release as singles, while logistics for the release of the entire album are being finalised
