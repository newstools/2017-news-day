A JOHANE Masowe yeChishanu leader based in Beitbridge, Tinotenda Chikwanha, allegedly attacked a fellow church prophet with an axe following a brawl over use of a spirit medium while prophesying. BY SILAS NKALAThe incident allegedly occurred on March 25 at Chikwanha s shrine at the Zimbabwe-South Africa border post when the latter prophesied that John Takura was invoking a spirit medium to prophesy in church. Chikwanha argued that use of a spirit medium contradicted the church s doctrine.This did not go down well with Takura who later confronted Chikwanha (32) at his shrine, leading to the alleged physical fight.Chikwanha denied the assault charge last week when he appeared before Beitbridge magistrate Trevor Nyatsanza. He was remanded to April 3 for trial.Prosecutor Munyonga Kuvarega told the court that on March 25, Chikwanha and Takura had a heated dispute following the former s prophesy. Chikwanha attacked Takura with the back of the axe on the left shoulder.Takura allegedly fell to the ground and sustained injuries on both knees. He later reported the alleged assault to the police, leading to Chikwanha s arrest.
