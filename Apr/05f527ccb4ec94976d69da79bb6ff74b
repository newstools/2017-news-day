BY ARTS REPORTERNicholas Zacharia (left) and Alick Macheso at the album launch at Aquatic Complex in Chitungwiza at the weekendThe pre-gig hype, complete with roadshows and on-the-hour radio adverts, saw the Takakomborerwa album launch, organised by Zimbabwe Business and Arts Hub (Zibah), bringing together top musicians that emerged from Chitungwiza Zakaria, Alick Macheso as well as Charles and Olivia Charamba. This is a dream come true for me and I am at a loss for words as to how I can thank the Zibah team, Nash Paints, Esteem Communications, Club Joy Centre and Joem Enterprises, who made this event a success. To Khiama fans, I want to say a big thank you and please continue supporting us, an overwhelmed Zakaria said.Several music groups including the Charambas, Isaac Tazvida, Tryson Chimbetu and Beverly Sibanda all took to the stage to entertain fans. Bev sent fans into fits of laughter when she greeted the crowd with whistles, an act believed to have been targeted at Andy Muridzo following a public spat over Bev s suspected pregnancy.Zakaria and Khiama Boys put the icing on the cake with a well-polished act, as they belted songs from the new album. Macheso then joined Zakaria on stage playing bass guitar on one of the new songs, before they gave fans a moment to savour with a powerful performance of the timeless Mabvi Nemagokora. Muridzo brought the curtain down with the crowd favourite singing Dherira and Zvipande. Music promoter, David Mudzudzu, who was part of the organising team and head of the Zibah arts and entertainment portfolio, said they were encouraged by the magnitude of the event.
