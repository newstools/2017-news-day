STAND-UP comedian, Carl Joshua Ncube (pictured) has for the second time been trusted by the organisers of the forthcoming Harare International Festival of the Arts (Hifa) to co-ordinate the comedy programmes at the festival. BY PRECIOUS CHIDACarl Joshua NcubeThe award-winning Ncube, who will be responsible for the satire and humour mix line-up featuring both local and international comedians, told NewsDay that this was a ringing endorsement of his prowess. It is really awesome that Hifa continues to give me this opportunity. I am a comedian, but I am also a producer of great comedy shows for other comics, so they (Hifa) are endorsing that fact, he said. I have produced and directed comedy shows for international acts like Jason and Donovan Goliath when they came to Zimbabwe and Daliso Chaponda s one man show and this year I will be bringing some international comics that I have worked with. The festival s executive director, Maria Wilson recently said there will be a mix of style and genres for theatre-lovers at the festival. The programming addresses stories with an eye to both entertainment and social impact. Productions from Kenya, United Kingdom and Zimbabwe combine to create an unprecedented opportunity for the Hifa audience, she said. Watch out for the Handlebards acclaimed production of Shakespeare s Midsummer Night s Dream. This year s edition of the festival, set to run from May 2 to 7 under the theme Hifa 2017: Staging an Intervention will see the grandee of local music, Oliver Tuku Mtukudzi being part of the stellar line-up of artistes who will perform at the official opening.The opening show, to be held under the theme Let Our Song Be Sung, will feature Mtukudzi, Amanda a la Banda from Italy and Grammy nominated Afro-roots star and humanitarian activist, Rocky Dawuni from Ghana.
