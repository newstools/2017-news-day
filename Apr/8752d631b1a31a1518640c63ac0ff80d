We need to up our sleeves but we will bounce back,&#8221; said the former Caps United gaffer, who should be beginning to feel pressure now.Chicken Inn coach, Rahman Gumbo saluted his side, saying that they were on top of the situation for the entire match. We deserved to win the match. We had an upper because we had prepared well and that is how we defeated them. I think the game they lost to Bantu Rovers affected them badly,&#8221; he saidThe home side created the first real chance in the 12th minute but Lameck Nhamo s well-struck shot was tipped over the bar by visitors goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze.Gumbo was forced to make an injury-inspired substitution bringing on Obadiah Tarumbwa for veteran midfielder, Clemence Matawu in the in the 17th minute with the former missing a glorious chance minutes after coming on. Chipezeze was again called to make a stunning save just before halftime, denying Russel Madamombe.The visitors had the better part of possession in the second half, but never really threatened the home side.Seeing that his side was ineffective upfront, Gumbo pulled out Thomas Kadyaridzire for Nyandoro in the 53rd minute and the veteran striker made the difference later in the match.The former Monomotapa player received a fine pass from Kudakwashe Gurure inside the box and drilled the ball past the hapless Triangle goalkeeper Ronald Mudimu.The home side threw everything upfront late on but the visitors defended resolutely to keep their lead.
