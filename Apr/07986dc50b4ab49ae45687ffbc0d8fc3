ZIFA have been beaten to the signature of Belgian mentor Ronny Van Geneugden, who has been appointed as the new coach of Malawi on a two-year deal. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKARonny Van GeneugdenThe 48-year-old will be assisted by former Flames international Gerald Phiri, who was appointed last month. The Belgian, who has never worked in Africa before, had applied for the Warriors job.Zifa are seeking to replace Kalisto Pasuwa whom the football governing body decided against extending his stay. And suitors, including Van Geneugden, had sent their applications through even though the post had not been advertised.The financially-crippled Zifa has not disclosed whether they will appoint a foreign or local trainer, although reports suggest they might want to continue with FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza.The Belgian coach preferred to coach the Warriors over Malawi, but delays by Zifa to name a coach saw him being snapped up by Malawi. Van Geneugden told reporters after his appointment that his immediate aim was to improve Malawi s world ranking. My target is to help the team rise on the Fifa rankings, but the most important thing is that there is a good style of play, the Belgian said.Malawi had been looking for a permanent coach since July last year after the Football Association of Malawi (Fam) cut ties with Ernest Mtawali a month before the end of his contract.The Belgian was picked out of some 65 coaches, including Pasuwa, former Warriors coach Ian Gorowa and former natinal team goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar, who had applied for the job. We are on a revival campaign to get back to winning ways and you know we are participating in the Africa Cup of Nations and African Nations Championships in the next year, so we want our performance to be better, Fam president Walter Nyamilandu said.
