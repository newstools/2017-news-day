BY JAIROS SAUNYAMAMunyaradzi MunodawafaThe Masvingo-born musician, who launched his career in 1998 at a tender age of 10 and rose to limelight with his debut album Mwari Anoona with the hit song Shandisa Chipo Chako, said the album could have been released in March last year, but lack of funds stalled the project. The album is complete and ready. The other song I did with [Mathias] Mhere titled Border Tavhara is already being played on local radio stations. This means we are going to launch the other 10 songs next month. I worked with some local artistes, but I cannot divulge their names now, it is a surprise to my fans. I also did a dendera song titled Mbiri and this has proved to be the best judging by the response we get when we play it at live shows, he said.Some of the songs on the album include Murangarire, Areka, Zvakatora Muchinjikwa and Chikwereti among others.After Mwari Anoona he did other albums, Farai Munashe (2006), Zvinouraya (2010), Zvava Nezodzo (2012) and Chikwata Chinokunda (2014).
