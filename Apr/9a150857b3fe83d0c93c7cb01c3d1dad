THE leadership wrangle at the Bulawayo-headquartered Apostolic Faith Mission of Africa (AFM) seems to be far from over even after the death of its president, Reverend Tony Tshuma, as disgruntled congregants have taken his successor, Reverend Rosewell Zulu, to court challenging his appointment. BY SILAS NKALA Tshuma, during his tenure as leader of the Lobengula Extension-based church, faced numerous legal wrangles with Reverend Clement Nyathi and his followers who challenged his authority and accused him of arbitrarily tinkering with the church constitution to extend his stay in office.In the new twist, two church members Claudious Manamela and Brighton Nanga, on Monday challenged Zulu s appointment as the church leader. In their application, the members cited Zulu, AFM, Tshuma s estate and the police officer commanding Bulawayo as respondents.They sought an order compelling the church to conduct fresh elections for any vacant post and stop blocking them from entering the church premises. The members also sought an order compelling the police to arrest and detain any member, who commits or threatens violence on them.Zulu, in his response, said the two were not members of his church, hence, had no right to seek his removal or to claim to have been banned from attending church.
