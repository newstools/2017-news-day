HIGHLANDERS midfielder, Rahman Kutsanzira, could return to change the team in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match against ZPC Kariba at Barbourfields Stadium tomorrow. BY FORTUNE MBELERahman KutsanziraKutsanzira has been struggling with a toe injury, sustained in pre-season training and did not feature in Highlanders first two league games against Bulawayo City and Shabanie Mine and the Independence Trophy. I only hope one of our key players, Rahman, returns this weekend, but eight others are still out, I don t have many options to change my style, but I will have to do with what I have and hope to get good results, Bosso coach, Erol Akbay said.Foreigner strikers, Yves Ebabali, Esono Obiang Ebuale and Tabwe Kalunga, who are being registered as free agents, can only start playing a month after the transfer window closed on March 31, while right-back, Bukhosi Ncube, midfielders King Nadolo and Godfrey Makaruse, and striker, Gabriel Nyoni are out injured with veteran Erick Mudzingwa serving suspension after he saw red in the match against Shabanie Mine.After being stunned by league returnees, Shabanie Mine at BF, Akbay is also cautious of visiting ZPC Kariba, a team that he subdued at BF last year. We must be focused. Of course, from what I saw last year, ZPC Kariba are not an easy team to beat. If they are still the same team, it means they are very dangerous, he said.The Bulawayo giants are up against the Sunday Chidzambwa-coached side, who have one win in the bag against struggling How Mine and one defeat to league newcomers, Yadah FC.Meanwhile, Kelvin Kaindu s How Mine will have to pick themselves up after a slow start to the season that has seen them lose to ZPC Kariba and Ngezi Platinum Stars and playing a draw against Tsholotsho.They host equally-struggling Chapungu at Luveve this afternoon.The airmen have lost to Hwange and Black Rhinos and shared the spoils with Triangle.
