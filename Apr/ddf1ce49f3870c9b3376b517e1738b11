HIGHLANDERS coach, Erol Akbay is thrilled by Roderick Mutuma and Prince Dube s striking combination and foresees a harvest of goals from the duo in the 2017 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season. BY FORTUNE MBELEPrince Dube. (Pic: Khumbulani Mpofu)Dube scored Bosso s first goal on Sunday in the 2-0 win against Bulawayo City with Simon Munawa getting the second, but Mutuma was involved in the two strikes.Akbay says the target for his charges is to, at least, score two goals in every match and he believes Mutuma and Dube s combination could do the trick for Highlanders. Prince and Roderick play very good football together. In the first half they played too wide apart, but in the second half they were better that is why they looked more dangerous, Akbay observed. Normally I want them to play compact and that is the tactical approach I want them to learn. Prince needs someone who will give him the final pass. Roderick needs someone who can play around him and Prince does just that and that is a good thing for me. Mutuma was unlucky to be ruled offside by referee Nomore Masundire after beating goalkeeper Aaron Ngwenya following Dube s pass in the 58th minute. We played very good football in the first half, but good football without scoring is not good enough for us, the Dutch mentor added. In the second half, we tried to play direct football and we knew our opponents would forced into mistakes. The last 20 minutes we did so many stupid things and we allowed Bulawayo City to play better football. They could have scored, but I am happy with the way my defenders played. My big problem with my defenders is they are sometimes overconfident and we have to sit down and talk to them. Sometimes some players think they are Ronaldos or something, but we have to be realistic they are not.
