TM Pick n Pay managing director, Malcolm Mycroft, said the idea behind the Village Walk, Borrowdale project was to introduce the country to a strip mall concept. We are now fast-tracking phase two, which is going to give us some 20 odd stores and some more parking. I think once it is completed in the next four to six weeks the road will be opened and it is going to be a wonderful place. We wanted more of an upmarket place, but with more of a family approach he said. People may look at the buildings, but the prices are still very competitive.
