CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League returnees, Bantu Rovers have made club president Methembe Ndlovu their substantive head coach. BY FORTUNE MBELEThe former Warriors midfielder took charge of the side in their first three matches against Chicken Inn, FC Platinum and Triangle.Club general manager, Wilbert Sibanda said while Ndlovu was busy with other engagements, the prevailing circumstances had forced them to go that route.The club is now head-hunting for an assistant coach, with Ndlovu taking charge of their fourth league match against fellow returnees, Black Rhinos at the National Sports Stadium this afternoon. The hunt is still on. We are looking for an assistant coach. We have appointed Methembe Ndlovu as our substantive coach, Sibanda said.Legend Agent Sawu, who had been earmarked for the job, has been appointed manager and he sat on the bench in that capacity when Bantu Rovers beat Triangle 1-0 at Luveve Stadium on Monday.Sawu, a holder of an English Football Association coaching badge, did not meet the standard qualification, a Confederation of African Football A Licence or equivalent, as required by Zifa.Ndlovu said his appointment was not the best option, but there had to be clarity for the team and the players going forward. It is not ideal, but the uncertainties have not been helpful, so we felt that we needed clarity of leadership for the group. I acknowledge there will be challenges due to my busy schedule. Things being the way they are, I think I have to take the job that has been given to me. I will do my best to develop young players and produce the results at the same time, he said.Bantu Rovers left for Harare yesterday afternoon for the game against Black Rhinos, confident after collecting their first set of points after they beat Triangle.They were hammered 5-0 by Chicken Inn in their first game of the season at Luveve before losing 3-2 to FC Platinum at Maglas Stadium in the second, with Ndlovu as coach on interim basis.
