RESIDENTS of Bulawayo s St Peters suburb have accused the local authority of neglecting most roads to the area, forcing them to rely on donkey-drawn scotch-carts as public transport operators were now shunning the route because of poor roads. By NQOBANI NDLOVUResidents from Khami Prison, St Peters have turned to donkey-drawn carts as these areas are now inaccessible (file)According to latest minutes of the council s environmental, management and engineering committee, councillor Ephraim Ncube pleaded with the local authority to prioritise roads in the area. Councillor Ephraim Ncube said that there were no longer any roads leading to areas like Khami Prison, St Peters. Cars no longer have access to such areas, even for funeral purposes, people have resorted to the use of scotch-carts. People in the areas feel that council had forgotten them, part of the minutes read. Councillor Gilbert Mangena s view was that a grader should be provided to attend to some roads in St Peters and other areas, by so doing residents would realise that council was making an effort to service the roads. A recent survey indicated that nearly 80% of the city s road network required rehabilitation and reconstruction.
