CHICKEN INN . . . . . . . . . . . 0 BLACK RHINOS . . . . . . . . . (0)1STANFORD Mtizwa s fairytale with Castle Lager Premier Soccer League returnees Black Rhinos continued after the army side picked up three points more from 10-man Chicken Inn side in a match played at Luveve Stadium yesterday. BY FORTUNE MBELECliff Chitsamba scored a gem of a goal 10 minutes after the break with an overhead kick beating the former champions goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze after he was set up by Benjamin Marere. Chicken Inn s Innocent Mucheneka got an unnecessary red card from referee Bonamali Bwanali when he lunged at Lot Chiwunga with both feet in the centre circle on the stroke of half-time.That red card cost Chicken Inn, who had to make changes going into the second half bringing in Thabani Goredema and an ineffective Darryl Nyandoro.Black Rhinos attacked from the outset in the second half and could have opened the account in the 55th minute, but Chiwunga failed to direct his header with only Chipezeze to beat from a Jameson Mukombwe cross.Mtizwa, who has won three games on the trot, beating Chapungu, Bantu Rovers and Chicken Inn, was ecstatic to get maximum points on the road against the former champions. We are happy with the win playing away from home against Chicken Inn, a very good side coached by a seasoned coach [Rahman Gumbo], who has won championships locally and outside the country. We could have scored more goals in the game and our strategy was to close down their flanks and we neutralised them and we had numerical advantage after the red card although they kept coming at us, Mtizwa said.TEAMS:CHICKEN INN: E Chipezeze, P Bernard, D Lunga, M Jackson, T Hadebe, I Lawe (D Nyandoro 46 ), I Mucheneka (red card 45 ), K Gurure, G Majika (O Tarumbwa 61 ), T Kutinyu, T Kadyaridzire (T Goredema 46 )BLACK RHINOS: H Rusawo, J Mukombwe, F Banda, B Homora, S Linyama, W Kapinda, D Mudadi, C Chitsamba (V Mhandu 67 ), M Kurewa, B Marere, L Chiwunga (Y Salima 90+4 )</strong>
