SKIN lightening products also known as bleaching creams have for a long time been on high demand in the country, with traders mainly cross-borders risking jail as they smuggle these illicit goods into the country from neighbouring countries like Zambia and South Africa. BY PRECIOUS CHIDAWomen are turning to beauty enrichment which is healthier than skin lighteningResearch has shown that a number of local women are risking their health using the skin lightening creams.In a survey conducted by NewsDay Weekender, several vendors plying their trade in the city corners and places like salons and free markets confirmed that they are making brisk businesses from selling these skin lightening creams which include Caro light, Extra Clair, Movatte, Princess and Epiderm. I am a widow and this is the only business that I have been doing for the past three years after the death of my husband and I have managed to send my two children to boarding schools from the money I am getting through selling these skin lightening creams, one vendor said. Joice Gwenzi, who operates her shop in a local salon in the Central Business District in the capital said in view of limited employment opportunities in the formal economy, she has been left with no choice but to trade in the creams. The government has failed to provide us the youths with employment and as a graduate [teacher by profession] I was left with no option, but to become a cross-border trader to be able to look after my parents. This business is proving to be viable for me that I don t see myself stopping anytime soon, she said.However, despite a number of women confirming that they use skin lightening creams, it seems tables have turned with the entry of beauty enhancement products as people now opt for makeup to lightening creams.Some of the products on sale include Black Opal, Sleek, Divine, Iman, Avon and Gucci.Zaron Cosmetics, who recently did a free make up testing along First Street in Harare, drew crowds of interested people. Our brand has managed to stay on top as society now accepts beauty enrichment, which is of course healthier than skin lightening, Zaron s sales and marketing representative, Rose Nyachowe, said.One vendor said make-up kits had always been there, but there has been such a huge uptake in the last few years that now it seems like it is a new trend. My business was going down because people are no longer buying the creams so I decided to sell make up products which seems to be in fashion these days, she said.
