Black Rhinos &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. (2)3 Bantu Rovers&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.0BLACK Rhinos season continues to gather momentum after they beat an out-of-sorts Bantu Rovers at the National Sports Stadium yesterday to record their second victory of the season. BY HENRY MHARAMilton Kureva put the army side on their way on the half-hour mark before defender, Sydney Linyama doubled the home side s advantage with a header in the 40th minute.A spectacular goal by Farai Banda with a quarter of an hour to go ensured Rhinos collected their second successive win in four matches.Winning coach, Stanford Mtizwa, said he was happy that his side had collected maximum points, but lamented his strikers failure to score. The team s goals so far this season have been scored by either defenders or midfielders.The game was Bantu Rovers fourth of the season, losing three and winning just once, a 1-0 victory against Triangle last week.Bantu Rovers team manager, Agent Sawu, said they are not worried by the results, but were more concerned with developing players.They had four Under-20 players in their starting line-up yesterday. The youngsters were, however, bullied by their more experienced opponents throughout, who dominated possession and could have scored more goals had they been more precise in front of goal. After wasting several opportunities, Rhinos took a deserved lead, when Jameson Mukombwe s cross from the right was connected first time home by Kureva.Linyama made it two when he rose high to head past Rovers goalkeeper, Stephen Chimusoro, for his second goal of the season.The lanky defender had another headed opportunity from another corner moments later, but his effort was cleared off the line.Lot Chiwunga then rattled the cross bar, as Rhinos laid siege on their opponents, who offered very little in both defence and attack.Banda made the scoreline more emphatic later in the second half, when his intended cross somehow curled to find its way into the opposition nets, as the gulf in quality between the two sides clearly showed.TeamsBlack RhinosH Rusawo, N Mukombwe, F Banda, B Homora, S Linyama, W Kapinda, D Mudadi, C Chitsamba (M Mine, 86&#8242;), M Kureva, B Marere (V Mhandu, 75&#8242;), L Chiwunga (Y Salima, 86&#8242;)Bantu RoversS Chimusoro, K Dzingwe, D Ndlovu, S Nyahwa, J Nsingo, M Chitambwe, B Sibanda, L Ndlela, M Mlangeni (M Dube, 46&#8242;), O Chirinda, N Sianchali</strong>
