BULAWAYO brickmaker, MacDonald Bricks has taken its business partner, Ginyilitshe Enterprises (Pvt) Limited to court for breach of contract and costs incurred in setting up a clay mine. BY SILAS NKALAMacDonald Bricks, which is suing for $27 240 damages, also accused its partner of lying that it owned a clay mining claim along Gwayi River in Tsholotsho, yet the claim belonged to Ginhole Investment (Pvt) Ltd.Through its finance director, Walter Zimunya, the brickmaker is seeking a default judgment against Ginyilitshe Enterprises, claiming the latter failed to respond to earlier summons. It was in terms of their agreement that MacDonald Bricks would pay Ginyilitshe $10 000 as deposit and prepayment for clay to be extracted. The payment was to be made before mining commenced. Applicant duly paid the required $10 000 by May 2015, the affidavit read. In terms of the agreement, the applicant would be allowed access to the claims and subsequently mining of the claim after the payment. In the event such access was to be denied, that would constitute a breach of the contract agreement allowing applicant to cancel the agreement. Zimunya said MacDonald Bricks was blocked from carrying out clay mining operations by Ginhole Investment, which claimed ownership of the mine. The denied access amount to a breach of agreement and the applicant was entitled to cancel the agreement and a refund of $10 000 together with damages for mine set up. The plaintiff sustained damages in the sum of $17 240 particoloured in the sum of $11 520 being payment for a dozer, $4 770 being payment for hire of low bed trailer, $630 being travel expenses advances and $320 to relevant authorities. MacDonald Bricks submitted that despite demand for the payment, Ginyilitshe Enterprise has refused, neglected, or failed to pay, hence, the litigation.
