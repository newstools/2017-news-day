VICE-PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa last week gave wise counsel, saying government officials should stop blaming sanctions for their failure and concentrate on getting the economy back on track. Comment: NewsDay EditorThe government has for the best part of the last two decades been holding onto the sanctions mantra like a drunk holding onto an empty gin bottle.Instead of working for the country to address the dire economic situation, government officials principally President Robert Mugabe have found a convenient excuse for their failures and shortcomings.Whether the impact of sanctions on the economy is overstated or understated, the reality is that the government has to live with the embargo and find ways of making the best out of a bad situation.For example, the ruling party promised to create 2,2 million jobs in spite of the sanctions, hence, blaming the sanctions for failing to create the jobs is disingenuous and plain lazy from the authorities.When Zanu PF came up with its manifesto for the 2013 elections the sanctions it blames for it woes were already in place for more than 10 years, meaning they said they would deliver within the prevailing situation.To turn around and blame sanctions now just does not cut it and in that regard Zanu PF has been a monumental failure.It is just inconceivable that the party will come up with more promises in the next election and hope to be voted back into power.Thus, the government should stop using the sanctions mantra as a red herring and get down to delivering on its promises.The government can moan about sanctions all they can, but good leaders should find ways of busting the sanctions and ensuring that the people s suffering is lessened.What Zimbabweans do not deserve are unending excuses for failure and want authorities to deliver, if they fail then they should make way for others who have the ability to do so.We hope Mnangagwa s fellow party and government collegues are listening and this will be the last time we hear about how sanctions are the reason we are in the doldrums.Anyone who uses sanctions as an excuse for the country&#8217;s economic mess does not deserve to be in government and ought to be axed or resign.Surely, the authorities cannot be still using sanctions to explain away their failures, but instead should be telling Zimbabweans of innovative ideas they have come up with to ensure the country continues ticking.We hope the government is listening to Mnangagwa s wise counsel to stop being cry-babies and instead start working to improve the situation in the country.
