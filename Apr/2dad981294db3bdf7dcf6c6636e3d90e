EARNINGS for short-term insurers nearly trebled to $13,40 million last year from the comparable period in 2015 on the back of an increase in net premium written and a cull in operating expenses, a new report has shown. BY BUSINESS REPORTER According to a report by the Insurance and Pensions Commission (Ipec), profit after tax rose from $4,62 million in 2015. Total profit after tax for non-life insurers increased significantly from $4,62 million for the year ended December 31 2015 to $13,40 million for the year ended December 31 2016. The increase in profit after tax was driven by an increase in net premium written by $9,94 million and a decline in operating expenses from $54,13 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 to $49,97 million for the year under review, Ipec said.The regulator said the increase in profit after tax has seen the industry s average return on assets and return on equity of improving to 7,06% and 15, 35% in the year under review from 2, 54% and 5,78% in 2015 respectively.Ipec said underwriting remained the major income driver for non-life insurers as reflected by the low ratio of investment income to net premium written which was 3,95% for the year ended December 31 2016. The underwriting profitability of non-life insurers improved during the year under review as indicated by the decrease in the combined ratio from 97,34% for the year ended December 31 2015 to 93,32% for the year ended December 31 2016, Ipec said.The volume of business written by the non-life insurance industry in terms of Gross Premium Written (GPW) increased by 1,19% to $215,97 million during the year under review from $213,44 million in 2015.Ipec said the slight overall increase recorded in business written in terms of total GPW was mainly driven by the growth in motor insurance business.Total gross premium generated from motor insurance increased to $93,14 million from $85,74 million due to the introduction of electric cover notes which meant that most motor vehicles previously insured using fake cover notes are now insured with genuine electronic cover notes and a natural growth in vehicle population.
