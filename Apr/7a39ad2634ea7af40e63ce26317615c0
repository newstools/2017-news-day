The Mutare City Council has resolved to continue funding Mutare City Rovers, which means the team will participate in the Zifa Eastern Region Division One this season. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Last week, councillors haggled over continued funding for the club at a time the local authority was failing to conduct some its core business, as well as failure to pay its workers salaries.

We are happy that the issue of funding has been resolved. This was affecting our preparations, you know it is difficulty to prepare if you are not sure what is going to happen next, he said. Definitely, we want to go back into the Premier Soccer League and we are confident that we have a good squad that can challenge for the top honours, he said.Mutare City Rovers recently fired head coach, Masimba Dinyero, three months after he was appointed.The former Harare City coach was fired after he was accused of presiding over shoddy preparations ahead of the new season, which saw the club losing pre-season friendlies to clubs playing in lower divisions.Kennedy Kachara is expected to lead the team this season.
