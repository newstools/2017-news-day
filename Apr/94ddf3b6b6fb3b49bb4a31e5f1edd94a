Musician Jah Prayzah s song Sendekera could have attracted mixed reviews among local music followers, but it is receiving fair airplay on the other side of Limpopo, Theo Kgosinkwe, the other half of Mafikizolo, has said. By Kennedy NyavayaMafikizolo s Nhlanhla NcizaThe South African pop duo made up of Kgosinkwe and Nhlanhla Nciza feature on the song.The group touched down yesterday ahead of their Sendekera, Come Let s Dance concert at the Harare International Conference Centre (HICC) tonight.Speaking to journalists soon after landing, Kgosinkwe lauded the collaborative effort, saying it will bring a different feel to what they have always done locally in their past shows. We have got an element of surprise, we all just want to make our shows different, though we do not want to forget that we need to play the songs that people know us for, he said. You would think that Sendekera will only be big in Zimbabwe, but at home, they are receiving it well as well, that is the power of collaboration and we are very excited about it. Nciza concurred: People are loving it, (as) we see even people on social media tagging us and everyone is loving the song and we are excited about that. She promised a flawless show, where they will stage the collabo live for the first time. What people can expect is me and Jah Prayzah performing the song for the first time, we have never performed the song before, Nciza said.She also took time to hype another song they did with Jah Prayzah, which is going to be on their upcoming album.Mafikizolo will be performing in front of their local fans in Zimbabwe as part of their 20-year music journey celebrations.Supporting acts for the show organised by 2 Kings Entertainment will include Andy Muridzo, Alexio Kawara, Cindy Munyavi, Sam Dondo and Ngoni Kambarami.
