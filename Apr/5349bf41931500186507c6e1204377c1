During my reign, I chose a project that recognises outstanding efforts of Zimbabwean teenagers through this teen awards event. This is meant to provide teenagers with a platform to be recognised and excel, Munyenyiwa said.Zim Teen director, Leslie Gurajena said the awards will help push teenagers out of their comfort zones to become competitive and achievers in their various disciplines. This event enables teenagers to have confidence and a confident child can make real change, starting from their disciplines and community with the potential to reach a global audience, Gurajena said.Finalists selected through a nomination system are high profile teenagers in business, finance, broadcasting, film and television, radio, arts, sports and academics. These include Tanya Muzinda, Daniel Bekker, teen model Yolanda Chimbarami, Joanna Munengwa, Floret Chikomwe and young academic, Maud Chifamba.
