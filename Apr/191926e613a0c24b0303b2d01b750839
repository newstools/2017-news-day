A PRIVATE legal aid society has launched a $500 000 information and communication technology (ICT) programme to offer free computer training for techno-savvy teachers across the country s 10 provinces. BY Stephen ChadengaGolden Knot Legal Aid Society managing director Peace Muregi-Pundu said the programme was meant to complement efforts being made by various government departments to capacitate teachers in computer literacy programmes. The ICT training programme we have launched today (Friday) is in line with the new curriculum by the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education to capacitate teachers in ICT training since most teachers are not tech-savvy, she said at the programme launch in Gweru. ICT is the (modern) way to go and if the teacher is capacitated, it can then cascade down to the pupil. Muregi-Pundu said the programme would be rolled out in the remaining nine provinces, with $50 000 targeted at each province.She said selected teachers would undergo a two-day ICT training workshop starting in the Midlands province before reaching to other provinces.The legal aid society also donated 10 laptops and a printer to the Midlands education office to supplement the ICT training programme.Established 12 years ago, Golden Knot Legal Aid Society has grown to offer diversified services in legal insurance, funeral assurance and services, debt collection and micro-finance, trust and legal services.
