BY ARTS REPORTERMafikizoloThe award-winning Mafikizolo duo of Theo Kgosinkwe and Nhlanhla Nciza will be performing for their Zimbabweans fans as part of their 20-year music journey celebrations.One of the concert organisers, Dee Nosh of 2 Kings Entertainment, who has promised a memorable event, said Mafikizolo would visit selected low and high-density suburbs to meet their fans soon after their arrival. We are calling for fans to buy tickets in advance to avoid pressure on the day of the show as we pursue to encourage people to move from buying the tickets at the gate, which causes unnecessary congestion with people ending up losing their valuable gadgets, he said.Dee Nosh said fans can purchase the advance tickets pegged at $10 for ordinary and $20 for VIP at all Coloursel furniture shops, Sopranos in Avondale and SM Distributors located at number 74 George Silundika Avenue in Harare.While the concert organisers have promised to release some of the names of the supporting acts soon, multi-award winning musician Jah Prayzah backed by his Third Generation band will lead the line-up of local artistes who include Andy Muridzo and Alexio Kawara who have so far been announced as the opening acts.At the concert, Jah Prayzah and Mafikizolo are set for a joint performance having collaborated on the song Sendekera that, however, appears to have attracted mixed feelings from local fans.
