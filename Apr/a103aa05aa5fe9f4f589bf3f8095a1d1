Health secretary Gerald Gwinji on Tuesday told Parliament there was need for the urgent disbursement of $1,2 million for malaria control, warning that there had already been an upsurge in recorded cases of the disease compared to last year. Comment: NewsDay EditorHealth and Child Care ministry secretary Gerald GwinjiWe agree with Gwinji, but we feel this call should have been made last year and the government should have already distributed the money, as a rise in malaria incidence was all too obvious.With the heavy rains that pounded the country in the rainy season, it was clear that the conditions were quite suitable for mosquito breeding and the authorities had to move fast to control the malaria vectors.Already there has been a 65% increase in malaria cases this year compared to the same period in 2016, meaning the government did not act adequately and quickly enough to prevent a disease that they knew was coming.What authorities need to do now before the disbursement of the $1,2 million for malaria control which is way inadequate is to go for the quick wins and low-hanging fruit like cutting tall grass in urban areas and removing all garbage that has the capacity to collect water, which are good breeding grounds for mosquitoes.Local authorities and the government need to ensure that residents are told of the dangers of letting pools collect in their areas and if there is a way this water should be redirected away from residential areas.After years of government and donor interventions, nearly every household in rural areas has a mosquito net and the Health ministry needs to go on a drive to emphasise the need to use these nets to prevent malaria and stop preventable deaths.In future, such campaigns should be ongoing and should not wait for the government to disburse money, as this may either come late or never.There is no reason why people are still dying of malaria in the day and age and many countries in sub-Saharan Africa are increasingly getting rid of the disease, yet we continue to record an upsurge of deaths.If Zimbabweans just stick to basics, ensuring that their immediate surroundings are well-kempt could be the first step in ensuring the eradication of malaria and many other diseases.Local authorities must also be proactive and double their waste collection efforts during the rainy season, as uncollected garbage is a mosquito s paradise, while other diseases could be lurking.On the government s side, the age-old clich says: Prevention is better than cure, meaning money for malaria control should be disbursed well before the rainy season, rather than this situation where they wait and lives are lost needlessly.
