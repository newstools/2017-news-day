Chief Justice Luke Malaba was finally sworn in on Thursday, ending a drawn out process of appointing retired Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku s successor, which sometimes threatened to turn acrimonious. Comment: NewsDay Weekender EditorWhile there is a celebration that Malaba s elevation is a victory for democracy and constitutionalism, there should be a strong reprimand for those that threatened the very pillars that our country is established on, when they sought to torpedo the process that led to his appointment.When he opened the legal year, Chidyausiku revealed that there was an unnamed member of the Executive who had written to the Judiciary imploring them to stop the interview process for the new Chief Justice, saying this was a directive from President Robert Mugabe.Mugabe, Chidyausiku disclosed, disowned the said letter and advised the former Chief Justice to proceed with the process.This is a clear case of a member of the Executive usurping the President s role and interfering with the work of the Judiciary and every Zimbabwean must be appalled.Questions must be asked about just how many things are done in the President s name when he would not have given his blessings for such.Such illegalities must be nipped in the bud and the only way to do this is by acting now and harshly, so that others of a like mind and persuasion would be dissuaded from doing this in future.If the Executive want to continue on their quest to amend the Constitution so the President can have the sole mandate to appoint a Chief Justice, then they can go ahead, what should worry Zimbabweans is when members of the Executive clandestinely give non-existent orders.One of Zimbabwe s biggest failures in the past 37 years is to have weak institutions, where the divide between the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary was blurred to a point of nonexistence.It is not by coincidence that the world s most prosperous nations have strong independent institutions, where roles and duties do not overlap, so these pillars play a watchdog role on each other, thereby, enhancing democracy.The 2013 Constitution gave the country hope that the Judiciary, Legislature and the Executive would be independent of each other, something that everyone should guard jealously and treasure.Thus, everyone should be worried when the actions of an individual or a group of individuals seek to take the country back to the pre-inclusive government era, which was responsible for the death of democracy and with it the collapse of the economy.Mugabe ought to act now and decisively, otherwise more transgressions will be done in his name and he will be held responsible for transgressions that are not of his doing.
