Norton MP Temba Mliswa (Independent) yesterday said MDC-T and Zanu PF councillors were equally responsible for the corruption that has stalled development and bled most of the country s local authorities. BY NUNURAI JENAAddressing about 500 residents who had picketed council offices demanding accountability, Mliswa challenged MDC-T leader Morgan Tsvangirai to stop politicising service delivery, saying opposition councillors were equally corrupt. I challenge MDC-T leader Tsvangirai, whom I hear wants to politicise the demonstrations, that he should come down here and see for himself how corrupt his councillors have proved to be in this Norton council. They bring a council chairperson on the basis of being voted when she can t even read or write, that is anti-development, he said. Mliswa warned both parties that they risked losing their local government seats because of corruption.Residents blasted council s decision to buy a $73 000 official vehicle for the town clerk at a time the town was operating without an ambulance and a mortuary.
