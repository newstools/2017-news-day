The Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZimRights) condemns the continued harassment of families at Arnold Farm in Mazowe in Mashonaland Central, whose homes are being callously destroyed in a bid to evict them without alternative shelter. ZimRightsThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has reportedly resumed its brutal tactics of evicting the villagers through force, assaulting and coercing them in disregard of a court order against the actions.The fact that the evictions that violate human rights violations are allegedly being spearheaded by the First Lady, Grace Mugabe, is a serious abrogation of the rule of law, accountability, constitutionalism and democracy in the country.The police have also reportedly given an unlawful ultimatum for the villagers to vacate the area. The fact that the police, who are supposed to uphold the Constitution and the rulings of the courts, are at the forefront of violating them is a travesty of justice. ZimRights calls upon the police to respect the Constitution, which expressly outlaws arbitrary eviction of people without a court order, and stop such denial of the right to shelter and destruction of property.There is a big danger to the fundamental right of many people to own land that is directly being posed by the amassing of land by political elites in the area, which flies in the face of social justice, non-discrimination and equality.
