LOCAL arts promoter, Plot Mhako is pleased that their Kuenda Productions is making waves on the global stage after their latest dance theatre production Empty The Space was featured at the recent International Community Arts Festival in Rotterdam, Netherlands. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOPlot MhakoFounded in 2013, Kuenda Productions is Mhako, Ugandan dancer and choreographer, Antonio Bukhar and German theatre maker, Cindy J nicke s brainchild.Speaking to NewsDay on Sunday, Mhako said the performance is an energetic fusion of dance styles; traditional Ugandan, contemporary European and urban. Our latest production, Empty The Space, was produced last year and premiered at Forum Ludwigsburg. It follows the success of Twenty Fifteen, which was produced in Harare in 2014 and featured dancers, musicians, actors from Zimbabwe, Germany, France, Switzerland and Uganda, he said. The dance play touches on social change as Antonio Bukhar and Faizal Ddamba explore the relation between European contemporary choreography and African traditional dance and introducing dance in community settings in and around their native Kampala. Mhako said although Empty The Space features artistic director Bukhar and Ddamba, both from Uganda, local artistes will be beneficiaries of many of their forthcoming productions. As Kuenda Productions, we seek to work with dancers, theatre makers, musicians, video artists and producers from different artistic and cultural backgrounds giving them an opportunity to penetrate the global stage and develop their career and network, he said. With our productions, we want to tell stories that change us, that make us laugh, think and move and that should be shared on a stage with others and an audience. Our experiences between the continents and our own wandering between worlds, makes us eager to tell stories that can connect.
