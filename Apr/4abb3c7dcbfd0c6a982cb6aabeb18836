MDC-T Harare Proportional Representation MP, Ronia Bunjira, has succumbed to cancer. In a condolence message yesterday, MDC-T spokesperson Obert Gutu described Bunjira, who died at a private hospital on Saturday, as a dedicated party cadre and the epitome of democracy. BY STAFF REPORTER The MDC would like to express its deepest condolences on the untimely passing on of our Harare Province women s assembly chairlady Ronia Bunjira, Gutu said in a statement. Hon Bunjira will be remembered for her selfless and tireless work in making sure that MDC remained strong, united, unshakeable and focused. We mourn the sad passing on of a gallant and fearless fighter for the total and unconditional emancipation of all Zimbabweans, particularly women. Bunjira s most memorable moments in Parliament include last year when she was among three female MPs who started a bench boycott by female MPs, who sat on the legislative chamber s floor demanding more commitment by government to safely bring home over 200 local women trafficked to Kuwait where they were being abused.She was also among some six MDC-T MPs who were last September arrested and detained in Harare s Waterfalls suburb for participating in an electoral reforms march. We urge all our cadres to remain united to ensure that Bunjira s dream and vision for a new democratic Zimbabwe is realised sooner rather than later, Gutu said.Mourners were yesterday still gathered at number 15 Mubvee Road, Mufakose, Harare, with burial arrangements yet to be announced.
