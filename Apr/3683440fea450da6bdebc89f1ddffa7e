By PAIDAMOYO MUZULUDhliwayo (45) is accused of criminally-insulting Sekai Madziyanhiyo, a nurse at Zengeza Clinic, on February 17 by calling her a prostitute and threatening to fire her when he accompanied his relative to the medical centre for assistance.In the second count, on the same day and at the same place, Dhliwayo is alleged to have assaulted a student nurse, Allen Chapfunya, who was serving a patient, by pulling him by the collar and pushing him against the wall for allegedly injecting the patient without supervision from a qualified nurse.Dhliwayo, whose trial continued at the Chitungwiza Magistrates Court yesterday, through his lawyer Harrison Nkomo, is denying both charges.The doctor denies insulting or assaulting the nurses, but said he was not impressed by the attention they were giving to his aunt who had been asked to buy her own syringe. I obviously got angry and reminded her [Madziyanhiyo] that I was not after prostitution and the lady in question was my little sister. I also reminded them that I was their senior as I had introduced myself and deserved respect, Dhliwayo wrote in his statement.He added that he reacted angrily to Chapfunya after he walked away from him while they were talking. I followed him and pulled him back by the arm upon which he snapped back at me with anger, Dhliwayo said.
