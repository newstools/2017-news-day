BY FORTUNE MBELEObey Makamu (9) reaches the PPC Matopos 33-Miler (53km) Ultra-Marathon finish line on Saturday The spectators watched and welcomed Makamu in awe, as he crossed the finishing line in just over four and a half hours, with his father, Brian, who also took part in the race, trailing behind by a few minutes.The full marathon s men section was won by Lyno Muchena of Mutare in 3:13:28 pocketing $1 000. Makamu s father said he had been doing the same course which starts at Matopos National Park together with his son and they trained for a month in preparation for the race. I lagged behind the boy because my phone was heavy, Brian said, provoking laughter from the spectators and journalists, who were covering the race. The race was very good because we have been doing the same route for the whole month and my intention, as I train the boy, is that he becomes the youngest runner to represent Zimbabwe in the Comrades Marathon in South Africa when he turns 12, Brian said.Makamu is a pupil at Samathonga Primary School in Ehlekwini, but his father says he does not take part in school athletics, as he says the distances are too short for him and capitalises more on endurance than speed.It s not the first time that Makamu has been involved in long-distance competitions, as he took part in Cross Country Championships at Nketa Park in 2014 when he was six years old.He crossed the line in 28 minutes 39:66 seconds in the 6km race coming out in position 14 out of 21 in the Under-16 category.His father is a former long distance runner with Harlem Athletics Club in Mutare.
