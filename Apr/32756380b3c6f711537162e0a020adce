Buhera South legislator, Joseph Chinotimba (Zanu PF), yesterday called on the government to urgently organise for his ailing colleague Dick Chingaira, better known as Cde Chinx , to be flown out of the country for better treatment. By OWN CORRESPONDENTThis comes amid reports that President Robert Mugabe s Office had organised for Chingaira to receive State-assisted treatment at a private hospital in Harare.The Roger Confirm singer is reportedly battling leukaemia.Chinotimba yesterday told NewsDay that Chingaira played a pivotal role by providing moral support during the country s liberation struggle and, therefore, deserved special treatment just like top government officials who are often flown out by the State to seek medical attention. We as war veterans believe he [Cde Chinx] should access better attention elsewhere even in South Africa. We are the people whose treatment is paid for by government and he can be helped, Chinotimba said. We visit him every day and I am going to suggest this with other comrades today [yesterday] with a view to take further that proposal. Yesterday he was better as you saw from the video I posted on social media, he said.Mugabe and members of his family often fly to countries such as Malaysia for treatment, fuelling speculative reports that the government has lost faith in its public health delivery system.Policy Co-ordination minister and Zanu PF spokesperson Simon Khaya Moyo resumed his official duties early this month after spending nearly a year undergoing treatment in South Africa.
