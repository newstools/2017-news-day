It later became a hit and was aired in 40 different African countries and now it is aired internationally on over 100 television stations.Karizma told NewsDay last week that he has benefited a lot from the deal financially and his music now reaches all parts of the world. I am really happy about the synchronisation deal I made with Shuga because the media attention stepped up a notch, which has been great, but there are also the financial benefits that come from licensing a song to such a big property, he said. The show is syndicated all around the world to over, a hundred different channels so my music is reaching way more people than before. Karizma said his songs will be sound-tracks on Shuga till the end of the season. The contract was to use my music in perpetuity, so for as long as this season exists anywhere, my music will be a part of the score, said the 33-year-old rapper.He won the best Diaspora in the Zimbabwe Hip-hop Awards and was also nominated for the Zimbabwe Achievers best video award.Apart from music, he is also involved in marketing management, music directing and video production.
