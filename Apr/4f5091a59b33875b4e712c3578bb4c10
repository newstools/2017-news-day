A BUDDING Zimbabwean artiste based in South Africa, Menelik Nesta Gibbons, also known as Don Dada, is set to storm the Zimbabwean music scene with his high energy hip-hop beat as he defied the odds and released a 13-track debut album titled Avant Garde, whose essence is a unique sound blending hip-hop, RnB and reggae. BY PRECIOUS CHIDADon DadaThe 30-year-old musician said he recorded the album in South Africa, but was forced to work from home due to lack of studio equipment.Tracks on the album are Intro, Prison, What Did We Do (Senzeni), Pheshe Phaya, Free Spirit, A Team, We Appreciate You, Dutty Riddem, Oh No, Crosses, Want That, V8 Coupe and Outro.Don Dadda told NewsDay last week that his debut album had been well-received by fans. My new album has the potential to become one of the best albums on our market with hit song after hit song because after listening to it, people find it so difficult to select a favourite. It is one of those albums that is easy to play all songs on rotation and has a radio-friendly pop-laced tune, crosses over genres, language and music tastes, but its basis remains African he said.With little financial backing, Don Dada said he had completed music videos for three of his Avant Garde album tracks working with other entrepreneurs and supporting each other by trading skills.Gibbons was brought up by a Rastafarian father and a Christian mother. He was born in Harare, but the family migrated to South Africa when he was five.Inspired by his father and Andy Brown, Don Dada said he had taken two young artistes under his record label, Ruff Cutt Studio. I understand the difficulties of breaking through in this tough industry, but I am in a bid to support other upcoming artistes so I have taken two young artistes under my record label, Ruff Cutt Studio, he said.
