As far as remaking the good old Zimbabwean music to match the new generation is concerned, it appears high flying hip hop and R n B artist Hillzy has made his mark with a rendition of Oliver Mtukudzi s 1990 s hit Svovi yangu, this time renamed ndiwe wega uripo . By RONALD MAGWETAA classic song that features on Tuku s Svovi Yangu album, the song is slow jam that speaks of a lover praising his wife.Hillzy, with the help of a producer friend and partner in music, Cape Town-based Beatsmith, has reincarnated Svovi yangu by adding a trap feel to it, and beautiful rhymes that go with Tuku s original chorus.Trap music is currently trending worldwide and is a favourite among the young generation.Hillzy who has become a favourite to many girls because of his love songs said it was an honour to remix the song of the legend and he had a great time creating the song. I am a really big fan of Oliver Mtukudzi s music and because my parents used to play some of his songs when I was growing up, I instantly became a huge fan, said Hillzy. I have always wanted to work with Mr Mtukudzi ever since I started my music career so I thought maybe doing a remix to one of his hit songs is a very good idea he said. With only a few days after being released, the song has already sent his fans into frenzy and is currently doing well on digital platforms like YouTube and SoundCloud. The 23 year old student is currently working on an album which titled TUTOR II which is going to be released later this year with his friend H3nry. Hillzy s music can be found on all digital music platforms like iTunes, Tidal, and Spotify.
