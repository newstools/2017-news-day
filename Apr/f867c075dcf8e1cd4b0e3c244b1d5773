Thirteen-year-old Zimbabwe karting prodigy, Zac Dufty, is set to make his debut in the new international racing class Motor South Africa Academy Series, which enters the second round at Vereeniging Kart Track in South Africa on Saturday. BY MUNYARADZI MADZOKEREDufty, who left the country with his father and mechanic, Kevin, yesterday, missed the first round of the new karting format, which is an official CIK-FIA class for junior competitors around the world, with a broken rib last month.The karting sensation, who has represented Zimbabwe at the World Championships, is the only non-South African competing. I am confident of doing well although it will be my first time in this class. I will be aiming for a top-five finish. I am going to give it everything I can, the young driver, who dreams of racing in Formula 1 one day, said.The MSA series, a replica format of the CIK-FIA Karting Academy Trophy raced in Europe, was introduced in South Africa this year to provide a potential stepping stone for young karters.Popularly known as Zac in karting circuits, Dufty has been racing regularly in South Africa for the past three years.In his last race in South Africa, he finished fifth while he carried an injury back in February.Dufty s father, Kevin, who also plays the role of manager and mechanic, bemoaned his son s lack of practice and a practice kart. He has a very good style, very smooth and sensitive, but he has not had as much seat time as he should have ahead of this event. We also do not have a kart of the right class for him to practise, he said. Ideally, we need a kart for practise and we are looking for sponsors to assist. I am confident if he has adequate practice he would finish on the podium regularly, he said.The series will be in six different rounds during the course of the year and the winner will receive entry to the Rok Cup International Final and also be the MSA representative to the Junior CIK-FIA Academy Trophy for 2018.
