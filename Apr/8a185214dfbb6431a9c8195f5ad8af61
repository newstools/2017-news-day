Home Affairs minister Ignatius Chombo s former wife Marian has fallen on hard times and cannot afford to pay back a longstanding debt to CBZ Bank after she was declared a person of no means . BY BLESSED MHLANGAThe deputy sheriff, who had visited Marian s Allan Grange Farm in Raffingora with the intention to attach property on April 9 to offset the $157 229,10 debt, found nothing on the farm worth taking.As a sign that all is not well for Marian, who was involved in a lengthy and messy divorce wrangle over the sharing of a vast array of properties owned by her estranged husband Ignatius, the sheriff entered a nulla bona (no goods) report on the property. Attempted to service, no property pointed out or seen, nulla bona, the deputy sheriff s remarks read.Through its lawyer, Obert Gutu, CBZ Bank is demanding $157 229,10 from Marian, which she borrowed in 2009 as an overdraft facility.She is also supposed to pay collection commission in terms of the Law Society of Zimbabwe by-laws and also meet the costs of the suit after High Court judge Justice Loice Matanda-Moyo issued a default judgment against her in March.The farm at the height of the divorce was reported to have been home to an International 9700 horse 808-860V truck, Volvo FL6 dropside 723-023T, Mercedes Benz 1417 truck registration number 567-746P, Leyland Comet 16.16 dropside number 495-736S, Mamsen trailer tri-axle number 832-204Q and a Homemade trailer number 827-847H, among other properties.Marian was reportedly forced out of the marriage with Chombo, who at the time of their acrimonious divorce was believed to own a vast number of properties across Zimbabwe.During the messy divorce, Marian exposed her husband s stash of wealth which left many shell-shocked.Among the properties the then Local Government minister was reported to own included House No. 79 West Road, Avondale West, a Mercedes Benz 320, Flat No. B320, Odzi Court, Eastview Gardens, San Sebastian Flat, Cnr Tongogara/6th Street, and Flat No. B319, Odzi Court, East View Gardens.He also reportedly owned a Norton business stand, Chishawasha residential stand, Chinhoyi business stand, and Chelsea Flats, Block of 4 units, a Greendale house, Glen View 1 house, Glen View 7 house and a Land Cruiser vehicle, among other assets.
