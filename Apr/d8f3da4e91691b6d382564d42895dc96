The upgrade created a new 4km-long by 60m-wide runway and associated taxiways, capable of landing long haul wide-bodied aircraft.South African Airways became the first airline to have a wide-bodied plane land at the airport with a 222-seater A330-200 on March 1. Other than luring wide-bodied planes, the airport also attracted Ethiopian Airlines which began three weekly flights on March 26.
