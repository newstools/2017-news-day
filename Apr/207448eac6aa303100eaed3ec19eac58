BY Sports reporterThe result means the platinum miners have failed to collect maximum points in two games, while the sugarcane growers are still winless in the league.The miners came into the duel desperate for a win to maintain a presence amongst the leading pack. For the visitors, they were desperate to kickstart their campaign.Hillary Bakacheza played well for the hosts, but his efforts were in vain, as they failed to break the deadlock for 90 minutes.Simon Shoko got a chance 10 minutes before the breather, but his effort was over the crossbar. Coach, Norman Mapeza said his side deserved more and felt they had dropped two points rather than gaining a point. A draw to us is two points dropped; we did everything, but only for the solitary goal. We are still okay though, as we have eight points from four matches. We now have to keep on working hard and rectify those problems we had today, he said.Triangle coach, Taurai Mangwiro said he was now under pressure. I am now feeling the pressure. When results are not coming, you are bound to be under pressure. It s a good result against a good team like FC Platinum, we will build from this result in our next game and it gives us confidence going forward, he said.
