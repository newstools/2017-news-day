BULAWAYO gospel musician, Abigail Mwembe, is basking in the glory of her music video, Namata, which has broken into DStv channel, One Gospel. BY SINDISO DUBEAbigail MwembeThe video, which has also been extensively played on ZBC TV, is off Mwembe s third album, Basking in His Glory, which also carries tracks such as Hakuna Zita Sera Jesu, You Are Alpha and Omega and Mutsvene. The feeling is the best of all feelings. I submitted my video and songs last year and they only started playing them at the beginning of the year. Fans started calling me telling me that they are watching my work every day, she said. I shed tears of joy when I first heard that I am on One Gospel. It s one of the prestigious channels that every gospel musician longs to feature on, Mwembe said. I am happy that from being featured on a channel at home (ZBC TV) I get to be on a continentally recognised platform, this makes me work extra hard to better my previous works as a musician. Basking in His Glory is a multilingual album with tracks done in Shona, English and Tonga.Mwembe said she usually sung in her Tonga language as a way of promoting her roots. Since I am from Binga, using my language, Tonga, is the best way I can push my cultural background through my music, she said.The Namata hit maker worked with a local group, Hossana, from Harvest House Church, on the album, which was recorded in Bulawayo.The musician, who is originally from Binga has so far released three albums: Makabongwe (2001), Tataleza (2005) and Basking in His Glory (2017).
