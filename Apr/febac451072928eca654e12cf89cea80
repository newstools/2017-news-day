GOVERNMENT says it plans to install biometric scanners at its border posts to enable immigration officials to easily identify people passing through and to check if the information on their passports tallies with their physical identities. BY SHARON SIBINDIHome Affairs deputy minister Obedingwa Mguni told Southern Eye recently that government had acquired 70 scanners for that purpose. We are trying to work on the installation of the iris recognition scanners and at the moment some software is needed in the installation and as soon we are ready, we will tell you, he said.This comes amid reports that neighbouring South Africa was planning to introduce stringent entry requirements at its ports of entry, particularly at Beitbridge Border Post, to guard against illegal immigrants.Mguni said South Africa was already using the new technology, adding Zimbabwe procured its scanners with the help of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa.
