We want to use the medium of television to have a conversation with the average individual through the conversations we host with our guests. The aim is to make the individual our viewer, realise they can be a part of their development and progress through the conversations we have on Thatha Wena. Co-producer, Mothobe said the goal is to build a better society through a television show. With so many people glued to their television screens, what better medium is there to plant relevant ideas and suggest relevant and meaningful conversation to people, he said. It carries the simple, but important aspects of everyday life or human behaviour that if either changed or is implemented (depending on whether it is bad or good) can develop our society for the better. Mothobe said they expected to feature guests such as historian, Pathisa Nyathi, image and brand management specialist, Nontokozo Masuku and activist and broadcaster, Soneni Gwizi among others.
