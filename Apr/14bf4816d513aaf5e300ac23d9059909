Zambian opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema has been detained and questioned by police for committing &#8220;treason&#8221;, his lawyer said on Tuesday. ReutersHakainde HichilemaHichilema, a wealthy economist known as &#8220;HH&#8221;, was defeated by President Edgar Lungu in an election last August, which he described as fraudulent. His attempts to mount a legal challenge have so far been unsuccessful.Although authorities could not immediately confirm why Hichilema was being questioned, his lawyer Jack Mwiimbu told Reuters: &#8220;They have detained him for having committed treason along Limulunga road by obstructing the presidential motorcade.&#8220;He has not yet been formally charged. We are definitely challenging the police action.&#8221;A spokesman for Hichilema&#8217;s United Party for National Development (UPND), Charles Kakoma, said police broke doors before raiding the opposition leader&#8217;s house in an exclusive suburb of Lusaka.He said police had blocked the access road to the residence but did not say what they were looking for.&#8220;They broke the doors and teargassed the house,&#8221; Kakoma said. &#8220;They left the home after picking him.&#8221;Mwiimbu said Hichilema was unwell after the raid.&#8220;He is not well because of the tear gas. His wife fainted three times last night because of the tear gas,&#8221; he said.Neither police nor Hichilema were available to comment.On Sunday, presidential spokesman Amos Chanda said Hichilema had obstructed Lungu&#8217;s motorcade, saying Hichilema&#8217;s motorcade maintained its lane instead of getting off the road.Hichilema was granted bail in October after being charged with sedition, a move his team said was an attempt by the ruling party to silence dissent.The opposition leader had been accused of assembly without a permit after he gave an impromptu address in the rural town of Mpongwe, police said.
