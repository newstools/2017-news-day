THE Gweru City Council has blamed a local company, which won a $1,2 million earth-moving equipment tender for failing to fulfil its part of the bargain, thus delaying the servicing of 6 000 residential stands in Mkoba 21. BY Stephen ChadengaTown clerk, Elizabeth Gwatipedza said the company, which she declined to name, had only supplied equipment worth $250 000. The unnamed firm won the tender to supply a bulldozer, excavator, grader and a backhoe. This week, a backhoe valued at about $90 000 was delivered, while the grader, which cost more than $150 000 was received last week, she said. The delay has affected rehabilitation of the roads and servicing of stands in Mkoba 21, Gwatipedza added.This came amid reports that the company was failing to secure adequate foreign currency to pay for the equipment currently stuck in neighbouring South Africa.The cash-strapped council offered the 6 000 stands to potential buyers in early 2015, but found no takers, as they have not yet been serviced.
